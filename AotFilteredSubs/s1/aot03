A Dim Light in the Darkness of Despair \NHumanity Rises Again (1)
You there!
Yes, sir!
Who are you?
Armin Arlert, from Zhiganshina!
Yeah? That's a stupid name.
Your parents give you that?
My grandfather!
Arlert, what are you doing here?
Trying to aid humanity's victory!
That is indeed wonderful...
Then you will feed the Titans.
Row 3, about face!
Who are you?
Thomas Wagner, from Trost!
I can't hear you!
Thomas Wagner, from—
{\an8}Too soft! Go practice in the cattle shed!
There he goes...
When you were a trainee,
{\an8}You, next!
your first day was just the same.
{\an8}Mina Karolina, from Karanes!
It brings back memories.
Wrong!
You are from the pig shed, worth less than cattle.
Yes, sir! I am less than cattle!
{\an8}No, you're a fly, swarming around a pig's ass!
What's the point of screaming at them?
It's a rite of passage.
{\an8}Yes, sir!
We force them to abandon who they are,
{\an8}Next!
{\an8}Samuel Linke-Jackson, from Snate Village!
then raise them from nothing as pure soldiers.
{\an8}A horrible name! Change it now!
{\an8}What are you doing here?
It is a necessary process.
Sacrificing myself for humanity!
Row 4, about face!
It seems not all of them are \Nbeing subjected to that process.
{\an8}Listen up! I've seen a lot of shit in my time,
There is no need for those who have \Nalready undergone the rite of passage.
{\an8}but you are the sorriest pieces \Nof shit I've ever seen.
If I were to guess,
{\an8}You're in for three years of hell!
they probably lived through hell two years ago.
You can see it in their eyes.
Now, let's go.
Who are you?!
Jean Kirschstein, from Trost!
What are you doing here?
Joining the Military Police, \Nfor a life deep within the walls.
Oh, I see...
You want access to the Interior?
Yes.
Who said you could sit down?!
Anyone who can't handle this
will never make the Military Police!
Who are you? \NWhat are you doing here?
Marco Bott, Jinae City, Wall Rose South District!
I want to join the Military Police,
to offer the King my body and self in service!
Really...
I'm glad to hear that.
Good luck.
However...
The King doesn't want your body.
Next! You!
Who are you?
Connie Springer, of Ragako Village, \NWall Rose South District!
You're doing it wrong, Connie Springer...
I explained that this salute demonstrates
your resolve to devote your \Nentire heart to the people.
Is your heart on your right side?
Hey, you...
What are you doing?
You're the one I'm talking to! You!
Who are you?!
Sasha Blause, from Dauper village, \NWall Rose South District!
Sasha Blause,
what are you holding in your right hand?
A boiled potato!
The kitchen had a fresh batch, and I couldn't resist.
Did you steal it?
Why?
Why would you choose to eat a potato now?
Letting it get cold would've been a waste,
so I decided I should eat it now.
Well, I still don't understand...
Why would you eat that potato?
Are you asking me why people eat potatoes?
You can have half...
Half...
He's still making that potato girl run.
Wow, five straight hours?
But she seemed more distraught \Nwhen told she wouldn't get dinner
than when told she must run until she dropped.
If I remember correctly,
Dauper Village is a tiny hunting \Nvillage, deep in the mountains.
What's that?
The dropouts.
They requested a transfer, to the frontier.
What? But it's only the first day.
It was only a matter of time.
If you aren't strong enough, \Nyou have to leave.
Hard to believe they'd rather go back \Nto weeding and picking up rocks.
Hey, he didn't ask where \Nyou were from, did he?
Zhiganshina, the same as him.
I see... That's...
Then, weren't you there that day?
H-Hey...
Did you see the Colossal Titan?
Y-Yeah...
I already told you I saw it.
Really?
How big was it?
Big enough to look over the walls.
What? I heard it stepped right over them.
Me, too!
That's what they said in my village.
No, it wasn't that tall.
What did it look like?
It barely had any skin, \Nbut it had a huge mouth.
What about the Armored Titan \Nthat broke Wall Maria?
They call it that,
but it looked like a normal Titan to me.
Th-Then what's a normal Titan like?
Guys, let's stop with the questions.
I'm sure he'd prefer to forget some things.
I'm sorry for asking—
Don't be!
The Titans aren't all that tough...
If we can master \Nthe Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear,
they won't stand a chance!
Finally, I'm able to train as a soldier...
I was just so excited, I forgot myself for a second.
I'm joining the Survey Corps, so I can \Nwipe the Titans off the face of this earth.
I'll kill them all—
Hey, are you nuts?
Did you just say you want \Nto join the Survey Corps?
Yeah, I did.
And you said you wanted to join the \NMilitary Police to take it easy, right?
I'm no liar...
I'm a straight talker, unlike someone \Nwho pretends to have balls of steel,
even when he's about to piss himself.
Are you talking about me?
D-Don't...
Hey, I didn't...
Well, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to say you're \Ndoing the wrong thing.
Peace?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, too.
Hey, you...
W-W-Well, uh...
It's just that you look \Ndifferent than the rest of us.
I'm s-sorry...
Your hair is very pretty.
Thank you.
I'm fine, leave me alone.
You're always so impulsive when you're riled up.
This again?
Anyway, isn't your hair a little long?
It could cause an accident when you're \Npracticing with the Maneuver Gear.
Very well.
I'll cut it.
But how short should it be?
H-Hey!
That's my shirt!
What did you wipe on my shirt?
My trust.
Finally done...
This is...
Bread!
That's all I could get, but I saved it for you...
But you should drink some water first.
Are you god?!
God!
Hey, what are you two doing?
Um, she spent the whole day running...
So you're trying to do a good deed?
Did you do that for the potato girl?
Was the effort worth what you got out of it?
Well, it doesn't matter...
Anyway, I'm carrying her to bed.
Are you doing a good deed, too?
I'm doing her a favor so she'll owe me.
I'm looking forward to \Na lot of fun from this idiot.
First, we'll evaluate what you have!
Anyone unable to do this can't \Neven serve as a decoy!
They will be sent to the frontier.
These involve only the rudimentary basics,
but even at this stage, you can see their \Npotential with the Maneuver Gear.
Look.
She's steady as a rock.
She knows exactly what to do.
That's what I mean by potential.
Looks like we have a lot of talent this year.
Um, what about him?
That's exactly my point.
You may have the will,
but not necessarily the talent.
What are you doing, Eren Jaeger?!
Pick yourself up!
What is this?
How am I supposed to do this?
This can't be happening...
Information We Can Share So Far: \N\NThree-Dimensional Maneuver Gear Training (1) \NThree-Dimensional Maneuver Gear Training is \Na difficult process, meant to force the trainee to \N adapt from moving in a flat 2D plane to a 3D space.
Information We Can Share So Far: \N\NThree-Dimensional Maneuver Gear Training (2) \NHigh endurance, strong legs, \Ngood spatial awareness, \Nand nerves of steel are requisites.
Stick to the basics, and you should be fine.
Don't worry about doing well.
Watch the balance and stay centered.
Slowly rest your weight on the belts \Nattached to your hips and feet.
Stay calm, and you can do it.
I was able to.
Okay, I think I can do it this time!
Raise me, Armin!
Hey, Daz...
Isn't that the kid
from yesterday who said \Nhe'd kill all the Titans?
Well, I bet he'll be off to the frontier tomorrow.
We don't have enough food \Nto feed worthless rejects.
Eren...
There's no point in worrying.
You just have to figure it out tomorrow.
I'm pathetic...
I'll never be able to kill them all like this.
You should let that idea go.
What?!
You should give up on being a soldier.
There are other ways to fight than \Nby throwing away your life.
Listen here...
I saw what happened that day!
You really think you'll convince me this way?
But it doesn't matter how much you want it.
Why not?
It isn't your decision whether you \Nend up a soldier or not, Eren.
I'm not saying you should return \Nto the frontier alone.
{\an8}Let's go, Armin.
{\an8}S-Sure.
Don't worry...
I will go with you.
Um, anyway...
So, can I take that?
The trick to staying upright?
Sorry, but I'm a genius.
All I can say is to feel it.
Actually, I'd like you to tell me...
How are you still sane, after you \Nhumiliated yourself like that?
Guys, I'm begging you here...
But didn't you say just yesterday
something like, "People who aren't \Nstrong enough should leave"?
Am I wrong?
Or was it, "If you don't have the \Ntalent, you have to leave"?
Which was it?
Please!
I've heard you two are really good!
Bertolt... Reiner!
Sorry, but I can't imagine any \Ntrick to just hanging there.
I don't think I can give you the \Nadvice you're looking for.
Okay...
We'll just have to hope for the best tomorrow.
You two are from Zhiganshina, aren't you?
Yes... Why?
Then you should know how \Nterrifying the Titans are.
Why did you decide to be soldiers?
I'm not like Eren.
I didn't see them at close range.
But when I thought about how the government
forced people into that insane plan \Nto retake Titan territory,
I had to do something.
I see.
Where are you two from?
Reiner and I come from a small village \Nin the mountains of southeast Wall Maria.
But... That means...
Yeah.
It isn't like the big towns by the rivers...
The news was slow to reach us.
In fact, the Titans reached us first.
It was dawn...
The animals were unusually restless,
and we heard a rumbling \Nwe'd never heard before.
Eventually, as it got louder, \Nwe realized it was the sound of footsteps.
And when I rushed to open the window...
Beyond that,
I don't really remember.
Everyone was in a panic.
Hey...
Why are you discussing this now?
I'm sorry...
What I meant to say is this:
you aren't like the others.
The others?
Those here who don't understand how \Nterrifying the Titans really are.
Enough.
The vast majority are here \Nbecause they don't want to lose face.
Told they'd be admitting they were \Ncowards if they chose to be workers
after turning twelve, \Nthey became trainees.
But we're not really so different.
We chose this hoping to join the Military Police \Nbecause they're safe, deep in the Interior.
If that doesn't work, we may just give it all up.
I don't have any will of my own...
There's nothing wrong with valuing your own life.
I just want
to return to the homeland I lost.
That's all I have left to go on.
I'm going back, no matter what.
You...
Why did you become a soldier?
I...
I decided I had to kill them.
I had to kill all the Titans myself...
That was what I decided.
So even after seeing the Titans, \Nyou didn't surrender to despair?
No.
Though I don't know if \NI can even become a soldier now.
Review and recheck everything, \Nstarting with your belt.
Tomorrow will go fine.
You can do it.
Eren Jaeger, was it?
Yes, thank you.
Reiner Braun, right?
Eren Jaeger, are you ready?
Yes!
I'll do this...
I can do this!
I may not have talent,
but I have more guts than anyone.
Begin!
I don't know the theory...
I don't have any evidence.
But this is all I've got!
This is my weapon!
I did it.
I did it!
N-Not yet...
I'm not giving up yet!
Put him down.
I... I...
Wagner, change belts with Jaeger.
Y-Yes, sir.
Your equipment was defective.
The fitting on your belt was damaged.
I've never heard of this part getting damaged.
I'll have to add it to the maintenance checklist.
So, he managed to stay upright for \Na bit, even with a broken belt?
Wow...
Th-Then, did I pass?
You're fine.
Commence training.
I did it! I really did it!
Did you see that, Mikasa?
I can do this!
I can fight the Titans!
I don't need you taking care of me anymore!
I guess it all worked out.
He's looking at us, as if to say, "See!"
No...
He's relieved because he thinks we \Nwon't have to be separated now.
Grisha...
Today, your son
became a soldier.
Eren graduates from the Trainee Corps,
and he sees humanity regain its dignity.
"We can defeat the Titans."
Just as he becomes sure of this,
humanity learns a lesson once again.
