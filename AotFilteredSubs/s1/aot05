In the year 845...
the Colossal and Armored Titans
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,
along with the life we'd known.
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,
losing twenty percent of its population \Nand a third of its territory,
to retreat within Wall Rose.
Now, in the year 850...
Our counterattack
has only just begun!
Our target is the Colossal Titan before us!
This is our chance!
Don't let it get away!
Hey, there...
It's been five years.
First Battle \NBattle of Trost (1)
He was after the fixed cannons!
It's no coincidence it \Nwent for the gate, either...
This thing really is...
sentient!
But this is our chance!
He's the only one that can take out the walls!
If I can kill him...
Too slow!
You're mine!
What?!
Go!
I missed?
No...
The Colossal Titan vanished?
Eren!
Did you defeat it?
No!
It was the same as five years ago...
He appeared out of nowhere, \Nand vanished just as suddenly!
I'm sorry.
I let him get away.
Why are you apologizing?
The rest of us couldn't even move—
Hey, there's no time for discussion!
The wall's been breached.
If we don't patch it fast, \Nthe Titans will get in like before!
What are you doing?
The contingency plan for \Nthe Colossal Titan has already begun.
Get to HQ!
Anyone who made contact with it, \Ndon't forget to report!
Yes, sir!
Best of luck to the advance team!
Keep all personal belongings to a minimum!
Remain calm during the evacuation!
If they make it through,
we'll relive the tragedy that \Nbefell us five years ago!
We stop the Titans here!
Prepare to intercept.
Fire!
Attack!
You trainees have all passed
the final training exercise, \Nand now are full-fledged soldiers.
We expect great things from you.
It's okay, Hannah...
I'll protect you.
Franz...
Are you okay, Armin?
I-I'm fine.
I'll get over it soon enough.
B-But we're in bad shape.
We currently don't have the means \Nto quickly patch an eight-meter hole...
We never even managed to dig up \Nthat big rock near the front gate!
Since we can't seal the hole, \Nwe'll have to abandon the town.
It's only a matter of time \Nbefore they breach Wall Rose!
Besides,
they can wipe out humanity \Nwhenever they want, anyway!
Armin!
Calm down...
Things are different now.
Humanity won't be defeated by Titans anymore!
I'm sorry.
I'm all right...
Hey, are you paying attention?
Look...
I win again.
I'm nice enough to play with you every month,
but you never improve, Pixis.
I'm still no match for you, Marquis Bart.
Aren't you the high commander \Noverseeing the southern region?
How can you defeat the Titans \Nwith that level of intelligence and skill?
Commander Pixis!
Urgent message!
How dare you interrupt our game—
The Colossal Titan has appeared in Trost.
It's destroyed the gate!
This drink is excellent...
It will be my honor \Nto take it with me into battle.
H-Hey...
Wait, Pixis!
Pixis! Wait, will you?!
I won't allow you to leave.
You must gather your forces, \Nand defend my territory!
That's your duty, isn't it?
Marquis Bart,
my men are risking their \Nlives in Trost right now.
Commander, I'll ready your horse.
And it's likely that \Nmany have already lost their lives.
Many more dying this very moment, \Nas we indulge in idle chitchat.
They are expendable... Let them die.
And you've never even won at chess.
Your presence at the battle \Nwill accomplish nothing.
Do not worry yourself, Marquis.
In a real battle against the Titans,
it is unnecessary for the commander \Nto throw the match.
That's enough.
Marquis Bart,
please enjoy a peaceful day, \Nas you would any other.
Wait...
Pixis! Come back, Pixis!
Pixis!
Information We Can Share So Far:
Fixed Cannons (1)\NAnti-Titan weapons in existence before the \Ninvention of 3D maneuver gear. Placed on \Nthe walls and modified for defensive purposes \Nto address the dearth in mobile troops.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Fixed Cannons (2)\NGrapeshot: Low lethality; used to slow Titans. \NHE Projectile: Powerful, but extremely \Ninaccurate; targeted strikes are rarely successful.
Just follow your training! Split into groups!
Under the Garrison's orders,
you will resupply combatants, relay orders,
and kill Titans!
Garrison intercept forces will form the vanguard!
{\an7}Vanguard
Trainees, led by the supply team, \Nwill comprise the middle guard!
{\an4\fad(300,0)}Middle Guard
The Garrison's elite forces will form the rearguard.
{\fad(340,0)}Rearguard
Also, messengers report that the \Nadvance team has been neutralized.
The outer gate has been compromised,
and Titans have entered the city.
In other words, the Armored Titan
may appear at any time, to destroy the inner gate!
No way.
You're kidding...
If we lose Rose, too...
Silence!
As we speak, the vanguard is engaging them.
We have but one objective in this fight:
to defend Wall Rose with our lives \Nuntil the evacuation is complete!
Also, as you are all surely aware,
desertion in the face of the \Nenemy is punishable by death.
Mark this well, \Nand fight to your last dying breath!
Dismissed!
Yes, sir!
Why today?
As of tomorrow, I would've been in the Interior...
Are you okay?
No... No, no...
No, no... No!
You're in the way.
Hey, Jean... What's wrong?
"What's wrong?"
Unlike you, I don't have a death wish!
Since you wanted to join the Survey Corps,
I'm sure you're ready \Nto become Titan food anytime!
But I was to go to the Interior tomorrow!
Calm down!
I'm supposed to stay calm and die?
No!
Don't forget
those three years of hell we endured!
In the past three years, \Nwe almost died so many times...
Some of us really did die.
Some ran, and some were kicked out...
But we made it!
Didn't we?
So we can make it through today!
You'll survive today, and go to \Nthe Interior tomorrow, right?
Damn it.
Let's go, Daz!
Stop sobbing!
Yeah...
Eren...
When the fighting gets fierce, come find me.
Huh?
You and I are on different teams!
Plans will fall apart in the chaos of battle.
But I will protect you.
What are you saying—
Trainee Ackerman...
You're being specially moved to rearguard.
Follow me.
B-But I'll only slow them down!
I'm not asking your opinion.
The evacuation's falling behind.
We need as many skilled soldiers \Noverseeing civilians as possible.
B-But...
Hey!
Enough, Mikasa...
Don't you freak out, too!
Humanity is in danger of being wiped out.
What you want doesn't matter!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking clearly.
But I do have one request.
Please... Don't die.
I'm not going to die.
I can't die here.
I still have no idea \Nwhat the world is really like.
Surviving historical documents
say nothing about the Titans' origins.
We know very little about them.
What information we do have comes from
reports made by the Survey Corps.
There has been no evidence that \Ntheir intelligence approaches our own.
Consequently, attempts to communicate \Nwith them have been unsuccessful.
The Titan body structure
differs fundamentally from that of other creatures.
They lack sexual organs, and their \Nmeans of reproduction remains unknown.
However, most appear male.
They have extremely high body temperatures.
And inexplicably, they show no interest \Nin any creatures besides humans.
Their sole purpose in life seems to \Nbe the consumption of humans.
But considering they have survived for more
than a century in an environment devoid of human life,
we can assume they have no need to eat at all.
In other words,
we believe their goal in feeding isn't \Nto gain sustenance, but simply to kill.
As to why they have posed \Nsuch a threat to humanity,
their incredible vitality is the main factor.
Humanity has possessed \Ncannon technology since antiquity,
but it has proved insufficient.
Even decapitated Titans will not die.
And while this isn't universally true,
they are capable of regenerating \Ntheir heads within one to two minutes.
No way...
Just their size is enough of a problem.
Sir, does this mean \Nthe Titans are invincible?
They are not.
There is one way to defeat them.
Target this area.
Severe damage here will prevent regeneration,
and the Titan will die.
Thus, we use two swords to rend away their flesh.
If you can strike that vital spot,
you'll kill them before they \Nhave time to regenerate.
Hey, Armin...
Isn't this a great chance?
If we're successful here,
before even joining the Survey Corps,
we'll definitely rise quickly through the ranks!
Yeah, you're right.
Just to be clear,
a lot of people want to join the \NSurvey Corps this time around.
You got the best of me earlier, but not anymore.
You think so, Thomas?
Then let's see who can kill more Titans.
Don't pad your numbers...
Team 34, advance!
Support the vanguard!
Okay, let's go!
Look at all those Titans!
The vanguard's been routed!
What are they doing?
After all their boasting?
I never thought this would be easy,
but this is...
An Aberrant!
Stop!
Huh?
How dare you?!
Eren!
Stop! Don't go alone!
Wait!
I'll avenge Thomas...
I won't let you get away!
Eren!
Eren!
No!
Please don't!
Why am I...
watching my friends be devoured?
Why
can't I
move?
A...
Armin...
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
What's wrong, Armin?
My grandpa was hiding this...
A book about the outside world!
About the outside world?
You aren't supposed to have that!
The Military Police will arrest you.
Forget all that...
It says that the majority \Nof the world is covered
by a huge body of water called the "sea."
And it's all saltwater!
Salt?
No way! Salt's worth a fortune!
The merchants would take it all.
It's too big to take it all!
There's no way...
And there's more...
Flaming water! Frozen earth!
Plains of sand, white as snow!
I'm sure the outside world
is many times bigger than \Nthe world inside the walls!
The outside world...
Also...
This is still a secret, okay?
But my mom and dad say \Nthey're going beyond the walls soon.
The outside world!
Hey, Eren...
Wouldn't it be great if, one day, \Nwe could go explore the outside world, too?
Eren!
I can't die here...
Hey, Armin...
You told me about the outside world.
So...
I'm going out there...
Eren! Hurry!
A sudden rainfall.
The quiet sound of rain.
The humid air.
The scent of rain, ever so slightly sweet,
makes Mikasa remember \Na gruesome event from her past.
The World the Girl Saw \NThe Battle for Trost (2)
