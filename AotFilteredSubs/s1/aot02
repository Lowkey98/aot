Over a hundred years ago,
humanity suddenly found itself \Nfaced with a new predator.
They were far more powerful than humans.
Humanity was immediately pushed \Nto the brink of extinction.
The survivors built three walls:
Maria, Rose, and Sina.
There, they enjoyed a century of peace.
However...
That Day \NThe Fall of Zhiganshina (2)
"For till then I was a soul in misery, alienate
From God, and covetous of all earthly things;
Now, as thou seest,
here punish'd for my doting.
Such cleansing from the taint of avarice
Do spirits, converted, need.
This mount inflicts
No direr penalty."
No!
Let me go!
"O avarice!
What canst thou more, \Nwho hast subdued our blood
So wholly to thyself, they feel no care
Of their own flesh?
O avarice!
What canst thou more, who hastâ€”"
Eren, what are you doing?
We were so close \Nto saving my mom...
Why did you do that?!
We almost saved my mom!
Get a hold of yourself!
Eren!
Eren...
The reason you couldn't save your mother
is that you lacked the strength.
The reason...
The reason I didn't fight the Titan
was that I lacked the courage!
I'm sorry.
Ah, it's happening again.
Hurry!
To the inner gate!
Use all ships at the pier \Nfor Zhiganshina's evacuation!
Hurry! They'll eat you!
There are small areas that protrude,
like Zhiganshina, all around the wall.
Their purpose is to attract the Titans,
thus reducing the cost and \Nmanpower of defending the walls.
After the people of
Zhiganshina had fulfilled their function, \Nby drawing the Titans to them,
they were forced to evacuate by a single gate.
Don't bring anything aboard!
We're taking as many people as we can!
Armin, sit...
But...
Eren and Mikasa aren't here yet.
There they are!
Eren?
Don't talk to them just now.
Poor kids... \NGoing by appearances, it must've been bad.
Why are you just standing there?
Hurry!
Where are those cannon shells?!
Hurry!
They're right in front of us!
This just can't be happening...
Oh God, oh God, oh God...
Hey! What the hell?!
Wait!
Hey, what are you doing?
The ship's full!
It's leaving!
Please!
Please, at least take my child!
I'm sorry, but I can't!
Go!
Let him on!
Let us on!
You fool...
Where are you aiming?
B-But this thing doesn't \Nhave that kind of accuracy!
Right now, I don't give a crap...
Just load the next shell!
It's hopeless!
The gate...
It's closing!
We need to retreat.
We'll be left behind!
Hey!
Don't close it yet...
Wait a little more!
Many people are still in the city!
If they break through this gate,
we'll lose more than a single city to the Titans!
We'll lose the entire territory within this wall!
But that doesn't mean we \Ncan let these people die!
Close the gate!
The Titans are coming!
Get that gate shut!
Don't do it!
Hey!
What
is that thing?
Fire!
It's not working!
What is that thing?
It's coming! Run!
The Titan's coming! \NIt's going to ram the wall!
Close the gate!
The gate...

Several hours after Zhiganshina's \Nfall on Wall Maria's south side,
the news had spread throughout
the entire human territory.
Is it true?
{\fad(714,1)}Wall Rose, South Side \NTrost District
Have Titans entered Zhiganshina?
I can't believe it...
Why would walls that have \Nlasted a century fall now?
Whether you believe it or not,
there are people out there who escaped by ship.
At least five hundred, I'm told.
The question is if we've lost Zhiganshina alone.
But they would certainly never \Npenetrate Wall Maria, would they?
At the moment,
we should contact the central \Ngovernment and await orders.
We cannot handle
an emergency such as this on our own.
E-Excuse me!
A messenger just arrived!
They say Wall Maria has been breached! \NThe Titans are invading!
It's over...
It's over.
Humanity will be devoured by Titans again.
It's over.
I can never go home...
Why?
{\fad(1,465)}Why did I waste my final minutes with \Nher having some stupid argument?!
Now she's gone...
{\fad(579,1)}She's never coming back!
Why?
You lacked the strength.
Because I...
Because humans are weak!
Is crying all that we can do?!
I'll kill them.
Eren...
What's wrong, Eren?
Eren?
I'll kill them all!
I'll wipe every one of them... \Noff the face of this earth!
Eren...
That year, the central government decided \Nto fall back within Wall Rose.
During that period of time, \Nthe Titans consumed ten thousand people.
Eren... Karla...
Mikasa!
Please be safe.
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Dad!
Stop it, Dad!
What are you trying to do?!
Just give me your arm!
No!
After Mom died, you lost it...
Eren!
Let me go, Dad!
This is for your sake!
What are you talking about?
Don't forget the key.
You must get there...
Someday, you'll understand!
Until you do...
Eren, are you okay?
You were tossing and turning.
I feel like I saw my dad...
That can't be.
It was only a dream.
Was it?
Let's go.
They said they're going to distribute food.
This was once a food storehouse.
They're keeping refugees who fled by ship here.
Hey, don't cut in line!
Shut up!
I haven't eaten anything since last night!
It isn't yet certain that we'll survive.
Eren!
Mikasa!
Armin...
Look...
I got here in time.
My grandpa got these for us kids.
Thank you.
What's his problem?
There's nothing we can do...
I don't think there's enough food for everyone.
They say that's all we'll get today.
There are too many refugees.
And not enough food to begin with.
You know the farther out you live, \Nthe less they care, right?
Why do we have to share our food with outsiders?
If the Titans were breaking through anyway,
they should have eaten more, \Nso there'd be fewer mouths.
Eren!
Now there's just that much less food.
Ow!
What are you doing, stupid kid?
You have no idea...
You've never even seen it!
You've never seen the way they eat people...
Shut up!
I'm sorry!
He's just upset because he's hungry.
That's why he's being so rude to an adult.
I'm r-really sorry!
Jeez...
The only reason you aren't starving \Nis because of us, got it?
Even a kid should show gratitude!
Right!
Damn it.
No guy like that's looking after me...
I'm going back to Wall Maria.
I'm going to kill all the Titans!
Eren, you aren't serious, are you?
I am serious!
I'm not like them, sitting inside \Nthe walls and acting tough!
I don't need this!
Eren, you'll starve!
This doesn't bother you?!
We can't win until we can stop \Ndepending on stuff from them!
It's impossible!
We can't beat the Titans, anyway.
There's nothing we can do \Nbut live within the walls...
If you do something dumb, you'll die. \NLike my mom and dad!
So we should suck up to them instead?
Aren't you ashamed?
Right now... Right now, there's no choice!
That's just an excuse!
Then spend the rest of your \Nlife as cattle, weakling!
Mikasa?
If Armin is a weakling, so are we.
We didn't even run from the Titans \Nor from the city on our own two feet.
We couldn't even get the food \Nwe're eating today without help.
Anyone so weak couldn't \Npossibly defeat a single Titan...
What matters is survival.
Just like your mother said.
Mikasa...
Eat... And survive!
I will not let you starve.
Several days later,
refugees were sent in droves\Nto till the wastelands,
to bring in more food.
But even still, there wasn't enough.
And the following year, in 846,
the central government used many refugees
in an operation ostensibly \Nto recover Wall Maria.
Two hundred fifty thousand, in all...
Approximately twenty percent of the population.
But there were only just \Nover a hundred survivors.
Their sacrifice alleviated the food \Nshortage for the rest of us somewhat.
It's all because of the Titans.
If we destroy them,
we can retake our home!
Armin...
I'm enlisting next year.
I'll gain the power to fight Titans!
Me, too.
Armin?
Me, too!
I'll go, as well.
Mikasa, you don't have to...
Didn't you say that it's important to survive?
That's right.
So I'll go, to keep you from dying.
All right.
The three of us.
We now begin the enlistment ceremony \Nfor the 104th Trainee Corps!
I am Keith Shadis, and I had the \Nmisfortune to be assigned
to train you bastards.
And I'm not here to welcome you at all!
Right now, you're mere cattle, \Nfit for nothing but Titan food!
No, less than cattle...
In three years, we'll take you worthless \Npieces of crap and train you!
Give you the means to fight the Titans.
In three years, when you stand before a Titan,
will you still be food?
Or will you be a noble wall, shielding the King?
Or perhaps, one of humanity's \Nglorious soldiers that slay Titans?
You will decide!
Yes...
That's what I'll be.
And I will kill every last Titan in existence!
A failure as a soldier...
Swearing revenge against the Titans,
Eren becomes a trainee.
But when he fails at basic training,
he must confront a harsh reality.
