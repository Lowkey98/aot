The year 850, in Trost...
The sight of Eren Jaeger unleashing
the power of a mysterious Titan
was more than enough to \Nterrify his fellow soldiers.
I am a human!
He is not an enemy of humanity!
With my final breath before my death,
I shall wish for humanity's glory,
and try to persuade you \Nof his strategic value!
As Eren and his friends could do nothing \Nbut argue their innocence,
they were saved by Dot Pixis,
the high commander of the \Nsouthern territories.
I think we should listen to them...
Icon \NThe Battle for Trost (7)
I'll do it!
I don't know whether \NI can seal the hole.
But I'll do it!
Well said.
You're a real man.
I'll call my strategists. \NWe'll develop a plan!
No way.
That idea depends on \Nso many assumptions,
and he's just going to run with it?
I was just thinking the same thing.
But there's no sense in \Ndoubting his decision.
Commander Pixis must see potential \Nin something the rest of us can't see.
Something we can't see?
Also, I think there's a bigger \Nissue that must be addressed
before the plan can be executed.
And the Commander fully recognizes it.
What do you mean?
The Titans aren't our only enemy.
There's no time to waste.
I will need your help, young soldiers.
A plan to retake Trost?
You're kidding...
We have no way to seal that hole.
What is the brass thinking?
Going into Trost would be our deaths!
Since we can't seal the hole,
all we can do is die \Ndefending Wall Rose's gate.
Damn it... They want glory that much?
I have to return to that hell?
No! I don't want to die!
Let me see my family!
Hey, Daz, you're being too loud...
You there! I heard you!
Are you saying you want to \Nabandon your mission?
That's right!
This is nothing but mass suicide! \NIt's meaningless!
Have you no respect for \Nhumanity? For order?
If I chose to, I could \Nexecute you this minute.
Go ahead...
It's a hundred times better \Nthan being eaten by Titans!
Stop it, Daz!
No! Let me go!
I won't go back there!
Did you hear that?
Given the circumstances, \NI don't blame him...
Hey...
I hope someone rebels over here, too.
I'd at least like to choose how I die.
Hey!
I-It was a joke!
Do it...
Be loud...
And get others to go along!
In the Garrison, plenty of \Nus aren't happy, either.
We'll take advantage \Nof the chaos and leave!
Leave and go where?
To see my daughter.
Eventually, this wall will also fall.
They say that before Titans gained \Ndominion over the earth,
there was endless slaughter of human life
in wars over race and ideology...
Then someone said,
"If a powerful external \Nthreat were to appear,
humanity would cease \Nits wars and unite."
What do you think of that?
I've never heard that legend.
Sounds naïve...
Almost silly.
You have a warped mind like mine.
Even when that powerful threat
has pushed us to the \Nbrink of destruction,
we still have yet to unite.
No, but it's high time we did so.
Otherwise, we won't \Neven be able to fight.
Eren?
He's safe, huh?
Focus on the mission?
How dare he address a \Nsuperior officer that way?
By the look of it, Mikasa and \NArmin must be safe, as well.
But what's Eren doing \Nwith the Commander?
You want some?
Yes, please!
Kill me!
If you're going to \Nexecute me, do it now!
You're sure? I'll do it!
Attention!
I shall now explain the \Nplan to retake Trost.
For this mission, our objective
is to seal the hole where \Nthe gate was destroyed.
Seal it?
How?
Let me introduce you to the one
who will seal the hole for us...
From the Trainee Corps, Eren Jaeger.
E-Eren!
He is the result of a top-secret project
to turn humans into Titans.
He can create and \Ncontrol a Titan's body.
Hey...
I have no idea what the \NCommander's talking about.
Am I just too stupid to get it or something?
Would you shut up, idiot?
He will become a Titan,
pick up the giant boulder \Nby the shattered gate,
carry it over, and seal the hole.
Your job will be
to protect him from Titans \Nwhile he moves the boulder!
We don't have to fight the Titans?
E-Excuse me.
I don't mean any disrespect by \Nspeaking up to a ranking officer...
No, continue.
Y-Yes, sir.
Titans are typically drawn to pursue\Nthe largest number of people.
If we can take advantage of that
to lure them along the walls,
we can draw most of them away from Eren
without engaging them in direct combat.
And by using the cannons against those
lured away, we'll \Nminimize our own losses.
But since we can't \Nleave Eren undefended,
a small elite force should protect him.
And we can't avoid engaging the \NTitans that come through the wall.
The skills of the elite \Nforce will be critical.
All right, understood.
We'll take that into account \Nand revise our plans.
But this will only work if \NEren can carry that boulder
and seal the hole.
We are proceeding with the operation \Nwithout certain proof that he can.
I cannot help but feel doubt.
Indeed, given the uncertainty \Nof a crucial element,
I do not relish sending many \Nmen to their deaths.
But I do understand what \NCommander Pixis is thinking.
Yes...
The first issue is one of time.
Even as we speak, Titans continue \Nto enter the town.
The greater their numbers in Trost, \Nthe worse our odds of success in retaking it.
And the higher the chance \Nof Wall Rose falling...
And one more thing.
There's a limit to how much one \Ncan be motivated by terror.
Lift that giant rock?
Is it possible?
Has humanity finally learned \Nto control the Titans?
You're lying!
I won't put my life on the line for \Na plan I can't even understand!
What do you think we are?
We aren't...
We aren't pawns for you to sacrifice!
A human weapon?
He's lying!
He thinks we're fools!
He's telling us to die here, today!
I'm leaving!
Me, too.
And me!
I'm out of here, as well!
Wait!
You'll get the death penalty for this!
I'll spend humanity's last \Nhours with my family!
This is bad.
Yes.
If we don't do something, \Nthere will be chaos.
Ready to die, traitors?!
I'll kill you right now!
Here is my decision!
I shall pardon anyone who deserts now.
Once you succumb to the Titans' fear,
you can never fight them again.
Those who have learned \Nthat fear should leave.
And anyone wishing their \Nparents, siblings,
and loved ones to feel that \Nfear should also leave!
Daddy!
I can't do that...
My daughter is my...
My last hope.
Let me tell you what \Nhappened four years ago.
About our attempt to retake Wall Maria.
As I'm sure you're all aware,
that operation was no more \Nthan the government's way
of dealing with its inability \Nto feed all of the unemployed.
It was a culling.
The reason no one speaks \Nof it is because
by sending them outside \Nthese cramped walls,
we were able to survive within them.
All of humanity, including myself, \Nbears the weight of that sin!
Because so few escaped Wall Maria,
there was never any open rebellion.
But what about now?
If Wall Rose falls,
the sacrifice will be more \Nthan just twenty percent.
The territory within Wall Sina
won't support even half \Nthe remaining population.
If humanity falls,
it won't be because we were \Ndevoured by the Titans.
It will be because we killed each other.
We must not die even \Ndeeper within the walls.
I beg of you
to die right here!
I don't know if I can use the \NTitan's power to lift that boulder.
But I understand what I must do...
It may be a lie,
but I must make it happen anyway.
I must become a symbol
of hope for everyone!

I see you're all here...
You have one mission.
To guard Eren Jaeger,
eliminating any threat that \Nappears during the operation.
It will be the most dangerous and \Ndifficult task in the entire operation.
It's no exaggeration
to say that humanity's fate \Nrests on your shoulders.
Commander, may I say something?
What is it?
Does this human weapon really work?
Quiet, Riko!
You don't believe it, either, do you?
Commander, this operation \Ndepends on Eren Jaeger,
and we know nothing about him.
If he cannot function, many soldiers \Nwill have died for nothing.
Well, then...
Do you really enjoy losing to \Nthe Titans that much?
I don't.
I hate losing more than anything.
But unfortunately, I've been \Nlosing for my entire life.
I want to win against the Titans...
I want to beat those giant freaks
more than anything in the world.
S-So do we!
Then betting on him is our only option.
You're right, we know nothing about him.
But he's the only chance we \Nhave to defeat the Titans.
Commander, it's time for the \Ndecoy operation to begin.
Ian Dietrich,
Riko Brzenska,
Mitabi Jarnach...
You are the Garrison's \Nmost elite troops.
I'm entrusting humanity's fate to you.
Yes, sir!
Ian, you take command.
You have full authority out there.
Me?
I have no objections.
Nor do I.
But I'm not capable...
Don't worry.
You're a man who knows his drinks.
You're well-acquainted with \Ndrink both bitter and sweet.
I'm counting on you!
Yes, sir!
Eren, I'm sorry...
I ended up making you \Nresponsible for everything.
It's like I said before.
You have the ability to \Nfind the right answer.
I believe in that.
Eren, I'm going to—
Don't tell me you're going \Nto come with me.
You've been assigned to the decoy team.
But I can't leave you alone...
If you're alone, you'll—
Enough!
I'm not your little \Nbrother or a child...
I told you that!
Ackerman,
join the elite force protecting Jaeger.
We need your skill.
Let's go... It's time!
Bye, Armin.
Don't die.
Yeah, you neither.
A top-secret human weapon, was it?
As long as you can seal that hole, \Nit doesn't matter.
Our priority is to protect you.
We're counting on you.
Yes, sir!
Eren, are you feeling okay?
Yeah!
Eren...
I said I'm fine!
Much better than when \Nwe were surrounded.
We aren't playing house here, Jaeger.
I didn't mean...
I can't believe we have to
leave humanity's fate up \Nto a spoiled kid like you.
Enough, guys!
We'll soon reach the shortest \Nroute to the boulder.
I'm not seeing any Titans...
Everyone must have succeeded \Nin luring them away.
Listen!
You only need to get them \Nto the edge of town!
Avoid unnecessary combat!
Listen, Jaeger.
During this operation, \Nmore than just a few will die.
For you.
They will be our fellows, \Nranked both above and below us.
As soldiers, they're \Nprepared to die, of course.
But they are not pawns without a voice.
Wait.
Not yet.
A little more...
Go!
They have names and families.
And all the feelings that those entail.
Alyosha, Dominic, Phine, Isabel,
Ludwig, Martina, Guido, Hans...
They're all humans as \Nalive as either of us.
I've known some of them \Nsince my trainee days.
And today, many will die for you.
You have a responsibility to ensure that \Ntheir deaths will mean something.
No matter what happens.
Never let yourself forget that.
And be prepared to die \Nfor that responsibility.
Right!
I'll do it...
I'll make this happen!
Since the Titans appeared, \Nhumanity has never won against them.
Their continuous advance has meant
humanity's continuous retreat \Nand loss of territory.
But when this mission succeeds,
humanity will have retaken \Nits territory from them
for the very first time.
Right here.
Let's go!
This will be humanity's first \Nvictory against the Titans!
Green smoke round, confirmed.
The elite force has begun the mission.
Compared to all that humanity has lost, \Nit may seem insignificant.
But for humanity, that step will be a great \Nadvance in our attack on the Titans!
I doubt a human of that size
could lift that boulder.
But I believe Eren has the \Nstrength to lead us forward...
Eren?
The operation to retake Trost has begun.
As many soldiers die,
Eren, now a Titan, loses control
and destroys his own head.
The operation seems \Nto have failed, but...
