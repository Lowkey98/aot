In the year 845...
the Colossal and Armored Titans
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,
along with the life we'd known.
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,
losing twenty percent of its population \Nand a third of its territory,
to retreat within Wall Rose.
And in the year 850, in Trost...
Once again, humanity could \Nnot stop a Titan invasion.
Eren Jaeger had been \Ndevoured by a Titan,
but reappeared, emerging \Nfrom a mysterious Titan.
Response \NThe Battle for Trost (6)
I'll ask you once more!
What are you?!
A human!
I see...
Then don't hate me for this.
Marco...
I can't...
I can't fight the Titans anymore!
What happened?
My friends were eaten \Nright in front of me!
I saw them devoured,
and I didn't even feel sad or angry...
All I could think was, \N"I'm so glad that it wasn't me!"
But...
Next time, it'll be me...
I realized something.
Essentially, our job
is to fight the Titans \Nuntil they eat us, isn't it?
I'd rather die right now than be eaten!
Stop it...
Get a hold of yourself!
You aren't the only one.
Everyone is struggling with that fear!
Look at Sasha!
Even after what happened, \Nshe is still a proud soldier!
I have a terrible stomachache.
May I go join the wounded?
I can't do this anymore!
Stop it!
Stop!
I guess that gag order \Nwas indeed necessary...
Just look at them now.
If they learn about Eren...
A cannon shot?
Why only one?
Look! Smoke!
From inside the wall!
What?
What's going on?
Did they break through the floodgate?
No way! That's the strongest part...
Someone just screwed up \Nand dropped a shell.
But why is there so much smoke?
It can't be... A Titan's steam?
Wait!
Hey...
What is going on here?
It's alive...
Captain Wellman!
J-Just look at it!
It's too dangerous to get close!
Maintain your position \Nand remain on high alert!
Maintain your position!
Have the gunners load another round!
What is this?
I remember hearing the cannon fire...
And then there was a horrible \Nsound, a shock wave, and heat...
Are we inside a huge skeleton—
Eren protected us.
That's all we need to know for now.
Flowers survived, only inside...?
Hey!
Are you guys okay?!
Eren!
What is this?
No idea...
But this thing will soon dissipate \Nlike any other Titan corpse...
Let's get away from it!
Are they in shock, or just \Nwaiting to see what we'll do?
The Garrison isn't doing \Nanything right now, but...
They'll attack again before long.
After showing them this, I doubt we'll \Nbe able to talk our way out.
But I do remember one thing...
The basement.
The basement of my house.
Dad said that if I go there, \NI'll learn everything.
This happened to me because of him, too.
If I go to the basement,
I'll probably learn what \Nthe Titans really are.
Damn it!
Then why did he hide it?
Isn't that information
what thousands of Survey \NCorps soldiers died for?
Isn't it humanity's last hope?
And he's been keeping it locked \Nin the basement of our house?
What the hell was he thinking?
Where the hell has he been \Nthe past five years, anyway?
Eren.
Right now, we have other priorities.
Yeah.
The smoke's clearing.
When you see them, attack.
Let's end this here.
Don't move yet!
I'm getting out of here.
Where will you go? And how?
For now, I don't care where.
But from there, over the walls, \Nto the basement.
Once I become a Titan again.
Can you do that?
I don't know how I do it myself.
But I still think I can!
It's similar to the way you can't explain \Nhow you move your own arm.
Back there,
my only thought was stopping that shell.
So that body had no other function and \Nrotted away after having served its purpose.
This time, I'll turn \Ninto something stronger.
A 15-meter class, like the one \Nthat tore apart those Titans.
Eren.
Your nose is bleeding.
You look pale, and your \Nbreaths are ragged.
Your body is in bad shape!
How I feel doesn't matter.
I've come up with two options.
First, if you don't try to protect me, \Nat least they won't kill you.
Although I've already \Ncaused you trouble.
I'm thinking of leaving here alone.
No...
I'll go, too—
Eren,
I'm coming with you.
No!
If I can't keep up, you don't \Nneed to worry about me.
But I don't have to do what you say.
I've told you to stop all that!
I'm not your little brother, \Nand I'm not a child!
Information We Can Share So Far:
Yeast (1) \NA special yeast made only within Wall Sina keeps \Nfodder, wheat, beans, and other items from spoiling \Nfor a long time when placed in storerooms or tents.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Yeast (2) \NBy seeding storage caches with \Nthis yeast along supply lanes, \Nhumanity prepares to retake Wall Maria.
Captain, the next round \Nwill be loaded soon.
Should we attack again?
Wait for my signal!
Yes, sir.
The Garrison's giving no indication of \Nmoving to attack with their blades.
Mikasa's more sensitive than \Na stray cat to those things.
Loading the next round will probably take
a minimum of another twenty seconds.
Before then, Eren will have \Nmade his move and left...
Why would I remember these \Nthings at a time like this?
Is it because this is it for us?
And at the end, I was
nothing more than a coward, after all...
They saved me over and over,
but I was never able to save them.
As a friend, how can I stand \Non equal ground with them?
How could I say I'd go with them?
When even I'm not sure I can?
Now, the three of us
will probably never \Nbe together again...
Eren, I...
Wait, Mikasa.
I said I've come up with two options.
Armin,
I'll let you decide.
Huh?
I know what I've just \Nsaid isn't that realistic.
The smartest thing to do
would be to stay with the troops \Nand use this ability strategically.
I know it's crazy...
But if you think you can convince \Nthe Garrison I'm not a threat right now,
I will trust your judgment and follow your lead.
That's my second option.
If you say you can't, I'll do \Nwhat I described before.
You have fifteen seconds to decide.
Whether or not you can,
I'll respect your decision.
Eren...
Why would you entrust \Nme with this choice?
Whenever things get really bad,
you always know the right thing to do.
And I want to rely on you.
When have I...
There have been plenty of times.
Five years ago, if you \Nhadn't called Hannes,
Titans would have eaten Mikasa and me.
Was it all...
just in my head?
Only I thought that I was useless? \NThat I was just slowing them down?
These two never thought \Nthat for a second!
Armin, we're out of time!
Looks like the next round is loaded.
We can fire any time.
These two are putting \Ntheir lives in my hands.
The two people I trust \Nmost in the world...
What could be more convincing than that?
I will persuade them.
The two of you, avoid doing anything \Nthat'd make them think you're a threat.
Ever since Eren became \Na Titan and fought for us,
something has been bothering me.
I don't have it all clear in \Nmy head, but I'll do this!
I'll figure it out while I speak!
Stop!
You've finally shown \Nyour true self, monster!
I'll do it!
I'll give the signal!
He is not an enemy of humanity!
We are prepared to share \Nall the information we have!
I'm not interested in hearing \Nyou plead for your lives!
How can I believe you, when he's \Nshown us all what he really is?
If you say he's not an \Nenemy, then prove it!
If you can't, I'll be forced \Nto eliminate the threat!
There is no need for proof!
That's right... We don't.
The question isn't what we think of him!
What did you say?
I'm told that many of you saw him!
Then you saw him fighting the Titans!
And you saw the Titans swarm him!
That means the Titans considered him \Nfood, the same way they think of us!
{\i1}That{\i0} is the truth, no matter \Nwhat we may think or believe!
He's right...
A Titan as an ally?
That's impossible.
But if we could control a Titan...
Prepare to attack!
Don't be fooled by their clever lies!
The Titans' actions have always \Nbeen beyond our understanding!
It's possible they could \Npretend to be human,
speak human languages, \Nand try to deceive us!
We can't let them get \Naway with anything else!
No...
He isn't even trying to think!
He's scared of thinking!
Eren... Mikasa!
I am a soldier!
I swore long ago to dedicate \Nmy life to the revival of humanity!
If that pursuit were to cost \Nme my life, I would be glad!
If we use his Titan powers and \Nthe forces we still have,
we could take back this town!
With my final breath before my death,
I shall wish for humanity's glory,
and try to persuade you \Nof his strategic value!
Captain Wellman, I believe \Nwe should consider—
Shut up!
Their pleas are irrelevant.
They are traitors.
Anyone who violates the \Nrules must be eliminated.
That is my duty as a soldier!
Enough.
As big as you are, you've always been \Nas delicate as a newborn fawn.
Commander Pixis!
Do you not see his splendid salute?
I've just arrived, but messengers have \Nkept me abreast of the situation.
You go command the reinforcements.
I think we should listen to them...
Reports by the Survey Corps had said
the Titans would come from the south.
In fact, it was Zhiganshina District,
south of Wall Maria, that was attacked.
Thus, it was widely believed that \Nthe district south of Wall Rose,
Trost, had the highest likelihood \Nof being the next target.
{\fad(760,0)}Trost District, Inner Gate
Dot Pixis...
He is the High Commander
of the entire southern region, including Trost.
The man with absolute authority over
the defense of humanity's most important region.
No luck, huh?
I wouldn't mind being eaten by a \Nreally beautiful Titan woman.
And he is known to be a total eccentric.
What is the Commander thinking?
Allowing them up there unguarded,
when we don't know what they are...
I don't know.
The Commander's ideas are always \Nbeyond normal people's comprehension.
Captain...
The squads are in formation.
Oh, excellent.
I see.
And if we reach this basement, \Nwe'll understand everything?
Yes... Will you believe me?
As long as you, yourself, \Nlack absolute conviction,
I can't promise more than \Nthat I'll keep it in mind.
But I do take pride in being able to \Nrecognize the truth of what I see.
I'll guarantee your safety.
Trainee Arlert, was it?
Yes, sir!
Back there, you said we could use
the Titan's power to reclaim this city.
Did you really think so?
Or was it just a plea to save your life?
Well...
Both.
What I meant was to have
Eren become a Titan, \Nthen move that boulder
to seal the destroyed gate.
But it was just an idea...
I thought I could get them to at least
at least consider using Eren's power \Nto find a way out of our predicament.
Of course, I wanted to survive!
You wanted to survive.
I can trust those words \Nmore than any others.
Well, Trainee Jaeger?
Yes?
Can you seal that hole?
Well... Well...
I don't know.
I don't know much more than \Neveryone else here does.
So... whether I can do it or not,
I can't answer you for \Nsure when I don't know.
That's true.
I'm sorry.
I asked the wrong question.
Will you do it? Or won't you?
I'll do it.
I'll do it!
I don't know whether \NI can seal the hole...
But I'll do it!
Although they had fled out of fear,
soldiers choose to stand \Nonce more on the battlefield.
Eren decides to become everyone's hope.
