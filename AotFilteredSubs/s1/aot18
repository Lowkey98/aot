We will now begin the 57th \Nexpedition beyond the walls!
Onward!
We believe that in the basement of \NEren Jaeger's Zhiganshina home,
there are answers about the Titans \Nthat he himself doesn't have.
We will head there.
You new recruits will be here.
You'll be between the cart guard team
and the recon support team.
Your job will be to ride alongside the \Nspare horses and relay messages.
The Special Operations \NSquad will be here.
Standing by in the center \Nof the last ranks.
It's the safest place in the formation.
{\fad(180,0)}Row 5-Center: Standby
We're even better protected \Nthan the supply carts.
That's no Aberrant.
It's intelligent!
Like the Armored or Colossal \NTitans, or Eren...
A human in the body of a Titan!
Its movements are much more \Nprecise than the others' are!
Damn it.
I...
I underestimated it!
It protected its neck...
Damn it! I can't get away!
Jean!
Avenge the suicidal bastard!
It stopped?
That's the one...
That's the one that killed him!
He rushed to his death \Non the right flank!
Avenge him!
We've bought enough time, right?
Let's get the hell away from it!
No... Why?
Is it
heading toward Eren?
Forest of Giant Trees \N57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (2)
How's your 3D Maneuver Gear looking, Armin?
It's okay...
The clasp released as intended, \Nso it seems it's not broken.
I see...
I'm glad to hear it.
But what do we do?
We only have one horse.
If Jean's horse comes back, \Nthe three of us can move, but...
Damn it, why?
Reiner's horse returned, so why didn't mine?
We can't stay here any longer.
In the worst case, we'll have \Nto leave someone here...
But how would we decide who to leave?
Armin, since he's wounded?
Reiner, since he's big and would have \Ntrouble riding with someone else?
Or should I run and try to find my horse?
Damn it!
Why the hell do I have to think about this?!
We all made it through that fight alive.
This isn't fair...
Armin...
Hey, Armin!
Are you still out of it?
Yeah, my head's still a bit fuzzy...
I see...
But we must decide.
It's a hard choice, but someone \Nwill have to stay behind.
Wait!
First, let's fire a smoke round...
If the formation continued straight ahead,
the row 4-3 team should be nearby.
That's the signal for an emergency...
But I can't imagine they'll understand \Nour intentions just from that.
Armin, we can wait another three minutes.
By then, we must decide—
I'll stay.
But there's something I want \Nyou to tell them for me...
Preferably to Commander Erwin alone—
No, Armin.
You should tell him yourself.
Looks like someone's here...
And with two horses!
That's...
Krista!
Is everyone okay?
That's my horse...
Whoa, whoa.
Calm down, Buchwald.
He ran toward me, terrified...
Did you engage the Titans?
Armin, what happened to you?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
I can't believe that smoke \Nround brought you here.
I was nearby, and I already had Jean's horse.
Even horses like you.
It seems you have a strange charisma.
You saved our lives.
But I'm so glad
that the worst didn't happen to you.
I really am glad.
God...
A goddess.
I want to marry her.
Well, we should rejoin the \Nformation as soon as possible.
Yeah, there should be orders to retreat.
To think we've been pushed back, \Nless than an hour out of the walls.
Things are even bleaker \Nthan I'd imagined...
And for some reason,
it went in the opposite direction from \Nthe vanguard command team...
It?
A green round?
Looks like they're continuing the operation,
only changing course...
What?
That wasn't a retreat command?
What is Commander Erwin thinking?
In theory, any soldier has \Nthe authority to determine
when mission completion \Nis no longer possible.
Did command not see our \Nsmoke round somehow?
Even if we don't know what's going on,
there's still only one thing for us to do...
Follow the order!
Smoke round.
Green.
Oluo, you fire it.
Roger.
For now, everything seems to be going fine.
But is it really?
We may already have casualties \Non the front lines.
Reporting!
Message to pass along!
Right flank recon has been destroyed!
Our recon system is partially inoperative.
Pass this on, to the left.
Did you hear that, Petra?
Go.
Yes, Captain.
The right flank?!
I think that's where Armin is.
But Armin and the others should still \Nbe in position, near the center.
The Titans can't have made it in that far...
A black round?
Aberrants?
Eren, you fire it.
R-Right!
What a mess.
We let it penetrate deep into our formation.
It's almost here...
The Titan.
Beneath those smoke rounds, \Nis there someone fighting?
Damn it...
Look over here.
You monster...
Now!
Three separate attacks at once...
You're pretty smart, but you can't \Npossibly protect all three targets!
Spine, Achilles tendon...
It doesn't matter!
Hit one, and we will slow it down...
Go!
Damn you for causing so many deaths!
We'll make you die a slow, painful death!
It jumped?
L-Let me go!
The most important thing is \Nto ensure they hear of this...
I must tell them what we're up against!
An Aberrant?!
It got in all the way here?
We'll take it out!
We can't let it penetrate any farther!
The right flank's been wiped out?
But we aren't withdrawing?
{\fad(1450,0)}Row 3-1: Cargo
Why?!
No idea...
The Commander's orders...
Just relay the message to the left!
What's going on?
Row 1-13: Recon
We keep heading east.
Our goal is supposed to \Nbe south, to the old city.
Row 1-5: Recon
Right now, our formation's on a collision course.
Yeah.
You can see it...
The forest of giant trees!
Information We Can Share So Far:
Forest of Giant Trees (1) \NIsolated forests of giant trees can be \Nfound within and beyond the walls. \NThey occur naturally in certain areas, \Nand tree heights can exceed 80 meters.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Forest of Giant Trees (2) \NBefore Wall Maria's fall, this particular forest was a tourist area. \NNow, it is a strategically important location used by the Survey \NCorps to protect themselves from Titans during expeditions.
Seems Titans passed through here.
There's nothing growing on the road.
We can bring the carts through, too.
Send word to the rear
that only the central cart guard \Nshould enter the forest.
Yes, sir!
Excuse me, sir...
The center row appears to \Nbe entering the forest,
but wouldn't the rest of \Nus collide with the forest?
We're going around.
Yes, sir!
Hey, what are we doing at this tourist spot?
We're totally off from both our original \Ndestination and our return point.
I don't know...
I don't know, but the order came from \NCommander Erwin, after all.
He must have a plan.
What kind of plan?
Are they planning to hold a welcome ceremony
for us new recruits at a tourist spot?
No, I don't think so.
That was a joke.
Anyway, that giant woman's following us.
No matter what his plan, we can't stay here.
The only thing I can imagine
is that we're passing through \Non our way to somewhere else...
Everyone, halt!
All right. Listen up, recruits.
We will now make preparations \Nto launch a counterattack.
Draw your blades, and wait above in the trees.
If any Titans try to enter this forest, \Nstop them at all costs!
U-Um, sir, what do you—
Shut up and follow orders!
Seriously?
What's going on?
H-Hey, it looks like only the center \Nline went into the woods.
What happened to the formation?
It's gone.
The forest blocks our advance,\N so the left and right flanks
will have to skirt the forest.
We've lost our recon ability.
Why didn't we change course \Nto avoid this forest?
Did Commander Erwin read the map wrong?
I don't know...
Perhaps we tried too hard to avoid the threat
on the right flank and ended up here...
This is insane...
We've abandoned the original \Nmission to cache supplies.
And when we abandoned it, \Nwe should've turned tail and run...
But instead, we're forging \Nahead to a tourist trap.
And now, we're just standing here,
to stop any Titans that enter the woods?
Damn him for giving a crazy order.
He'll hear you...
And this no real explanation \Nthing is innovative, too.
Of course, I'm sure he has his own concerns...
What do you mean?
A commander deemed worthless \Nby his men in a critical situation
quite often succumbs to a \Nmysterious attack from behind.
I'm just saying it wouldn't surprise me.
Jean, so what are you going to do?
Don't be so serious...
This situation's got me a \Nbit worked up, that's all.
What am I going to do?
Obey my orders, and keep \NTitans out of the forest.
You also think it's the right move, don't you?
Ah—
You look like you know something.
Well...
Five-meter class incoming!
Why bring the formation here?
What is Commander Erwin thinking?
No, that isn't what \Nwe should think about.
The Female Titan is pursuing Eren.
And the Commander knows that.
Assume those two things, \Nand see what you can deduce...
Captain...
Captain Levi!
What?
Well...
We're in the middle of the woods!
If the center enters alone,
we won't know if Titans are approaching!
It seems something's approaching us from the right...
How are we supposed to dodge \Nthe Titans or protect the carts?
Don't go on and on about the obvious...
We can't do that anymore, of course.
Th-Then why?
Look around, Eren...
At all these big-ass trees.
It's the perfect environment \Nfor 3D Maneuver Gear.
And try to use that tiny brain of yours...
If you don't want to die, think.
Yes, sir!
I see.
I just can't keep up right now \Nbecause I'm still new.
He won't just tell me the answer.
I have to figure it out for myself.
I'm sure that's how they all learned to fight.
What the hell?
Seriously?
Damn it all... What the hell is going on here?
Wait!
Wait a minute... No one knows \Nwhat's really going on?
Maybe not even Captain Levi?
The Female Titan is after Eren...
If I'm right about that,
then there's only one reason to come here.
This is where Commander Erwin intends \Nto deal with the Female Titan...
Armin...
Our orders were to keep the \NTitans out of the forest, right?
In other words...
There's no longer any reason to fight...
Right?
A black smoke round?
It's from directly behind us!
It's whatever was coming \Ntoward us on the right.
Draw your blades.
If we see it, it'll only be for a second.
Go!
It's fast!
In these trees, there's no way to \Nforesee and evade its attacks!
It'll catch us!
Captain, let's switch to Maneuver Gear!
Captain!
You won't escape!
Reinforcements from the rear!
Captain, your orders?!
Let's go for it!
It's dangerous...
We should kill it!
I'll rip you apart!
Fool, you've run straight into hell.
You're chasing a group of master Titan killers!
Captain Levi?
Captain!
Give us your orders.
At this rate, it {\i1}will{\i0} catch up with us!
We kill it here...
That's why we came to this forest!
Right, Captain?
Captain, your orders!
Everyone, cover your ears.
The Female Titan continues its pursuit,\N leaving carnage in its wake.
Despite witnessing their \Nfriends being slaughtered
before their very eyes, \Nthe Survey Corps can only flee.
Eren is faced with a decision.
