The Survey Corps left to \Nfind a route to Zhiganshina,
but encountered an \Nintelligent Female Titan.
As soldiers died, one after the next,
they headed into a \Nforest of giant trees,
none of them knowing why.
If Squad Levi doesn't \Ndefeat it, who will?
Another one's dead...
And maybe we could've saved him!
Choose.
Believe in yourself.
Or believe in the Survey Corps and me.
I'll go forward!
Fire!
He can't intend
to take that Titan alive?
Well, Eren? See that?
We caught that Titan!
This is the power of the Survey Corps!
Don't underestimate us, fool.
Well? Do you get it now?
Yes!
Looks like it's stopped moving...
We can't lower our guard.
But you did well, leading it here.
Men in the rearguard squads died \Nbuying us the time we needed.
We couldn't have done it without them.
Is that so?
It is.
Thanks to them, we'll be able \Nto see who's inside this thing.
I hope they haven't pissed themselves...
Erwin Smith \N57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (4)
An Aberrant?
Or is it like the Colossal Titan?
Did Commander Erwin...
Hey, snap out of it!
Eren, think later.
We need to get farther in and stand by!
Right!
Wait, Levi...
An eye for an eye.
Waves 2 and 3, fire!
Fire the spare rounds!
Um, it's climbing up...
Yeah.
If it gets this far, I'll \Nmove out of the way.
But I don't think it will be long before
they issue withdrawal orders.
Does that have something \Nto do with the explosions
we've been hearing deep within the forest?
I don't know.
Mikasa, what do you think that sound is?
Are they firing cannons in the forest?
It didn't seem like they'd \Nbrought cannons, though.
It's really loud back there.
Hey, Bertolt...
Do you know where Krista went?
Sorry, I don't know.
I have no idea what's going on.
What am I doing and why?
I want to go home.
We're going to shift position, Armin.
Okay.
They've started to figure it out.
They seem to keep getting better \Nand better at climbing.
That means, scary as it \Nsounds, they can learn.
Although some are better \Nthan others, I'm sure.
Armin...
Sounds like something is going \Non deeper in the forest.
I think I have some idea what.
They lured that Female Titan all the \Nway here in order to capture it.
More precisely...
To capture whoever is inside of it.
That was Commander Erwin's goal...
That was his plan from the very start!
Right?
I can see why he wouldn't \Nhave told the new troops.
But why wouldn't he tell you
when you've all been with the \NSurvey Corps for so long?
Shut up!
Are you saying the Commander \Nand the Captain don't trust us?
But that's what this means...
Petra, rip out his teeth!
Swap the front and back teeth \Nwhen you shove 'em back in!
No, Eren's right.
I think there was a reason the \NCommander couldn't trust us.
Like what?
There's only one reason he \Nwouldn't trust his fellow soldiers.
There's someone who can become a Titan,
or a spy helping them, \Nin the Survey Corps.
You think so, too, right?
It has to be one of us.
Yes, I think so.
A spy?
Is that possible?
At any rate, the Commander is certain.
I'd imagine the only soldiers who \Nwere told of the plan were those
who've stayed alive for \Nthe past five years.
I see...
So that's it.
Must be.
Understand, Eren?
That's why.
Yeah, if that's the \Nreason, I understand.
He's assuming that five years ago, \Nwhen the first wall fell,
a spy infiltrated our ranks...
And that's how he narrowed \Ndown the possibilities.
Then, the spy killed Sawney and Bean?
Back then, the Commander \Nasked me about that.
What do you see?
{\fad(1,308)}What do you think the enemy is?
That's what the question meant?
If we could've answered it,
maybe we could've \Nparticipated in this plan.
I doubt that anyone could've \Nback then, though.
I knew.
But I didn't say anything.
Do you know why?
Why?
What, you can't tell?
Well, I shouldn't expect that \Nmuch from the likes of you.
You have yet to reach my level.
Hey, are you copying Captain Levi again?
The Captain wouldn't \Nsay anything like that.
If this succeeds, I can get closer \Nto the truth of this world.
But... Too many died, regardless.
Do you think the Commander was wrong?
I can't say he was right.
If we'd known there was a Titan \Ninformed of our operations,
we would've dealt with \Nthis in a different way.
Your team's squad leader and \Nthe others would've, too.
No, it wasn't wrong.
What wasn't wrong?
How many do you think \Ndied for no reason?
Jean, after the fact, it's easy to say, \N"We should've done something else."
However,
no one knows how things will turn out.
And even so, you have to make a choice.
You must.
The lives of a hundred \Nfellow soldiers...
Or the lives of all the humans \Nwithin the walls...
The Commander made his choice.
He chose to let those hundred die.
Eren, you don't know it yet,
but you will soon.
The reason that Erwin Smith is \Nentrusted with humanity's hope,
the Survey Corps.
Just look at how much \NCaptain Levi trusts him!
If you live that long...
I haven't lived that long,
but I'm certain of one thing.
If there's anyone who can bring change,
it will be someone willing to \Nsacrifice what they care for.
It will be someone who can throw aside
their humanity, in order \Nto defeat monsters.
Someone who can't sacrifice anything
can't ever change anything!
Information We Can Share So Far:
Special Target Capture Weapon (1) \NA newly developed weapon the Survey Corps \Ncreated to capture a specific Titan.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Special Target Capture Weapon (2) \NThe barrels are loaded with seven steel tubes, \Neach of which has coiled wires with arrowheads at both ends.
Fire!
How do you like that?
You won't even be able \Nto scratch an itch now.
You won't be able to make a single move. \NProbably for the rest of your life.
They're designed so that the \Nmore you heal your wounds,
the more immobilized your joints become!
But they still can't draw \Nout whoever is inside?
What are Levi and Mike doing?
It can selectively harden its skin \Nto protect specific parts of its body?
It's similar to what I've \Nheard of the Armored Titan.
If we continue using the Maneuver \NGear and blades, will it weaken?
We don't have time to find out.
In that case...
Yes, sir?
Prepare the explosives.
Blow off its hands.
Yes, sir...
But there's a chance \Nthat the amount we carry
has enough firepower to \Nalso blow up what's inside.
Then set them to amputate the wrists.
Set them all off at once at my signal.
Roger.
Hey...
Why not just come out?
We don't have time to waste.
So...
What do you think will \Nhappen to you now?
Do you believe you can escape?
I wish you'd consider all the \Ntrouble we're going through...
As I recall, you killed \Nmy troops in various ways.
Did you find it fun?
Right now, I'm having fun.
Well, so are you, right?
I think you can understand me.
Oh, right...
I wanted to ask you something.
Is it okay if we cut off \Nyour hands and legs?
They'll grow back, right?
I'm talking about {\i1}your {\i0}\Nlimbs, not the Titan's.
We need you alive, after all...
Well, that was a surprise.
Were those her dying screams?
Erwin, it stinks.
What direction?
Multiple sources, from \Nall directions at once.
What's up with them?
They're all running into the forest?
Why did they suddenly start ignoring us?
What?
They're all Aberrants?
It doesn't matter! \NDon't let them through!
Begin combat!
What just happened?
Wait...
I've heard that scream before.
In the forests where I'm from...
It's the cry of a cornered animal \Nthat has nothing to lose!
I was taught to exercise greater caution \Nonce a hunt drew to a close!
So be careful?
A hundred times more than usual!
If you underestimate \Nthe forest, you'll die!
I grew up in the mountains, too.
Someone who grew crops \Nwouldn't understand!
I see.
It's true that Sasha's \Nintuition is usually good.
Especially when she predicts \Nthings are going sour.
Armin thought Eren would be in \Nthe center, toward the rear...
Ready those explosives, now!
Erwin...
The first wave will come from the east.
They're almost here.
Cart guard team, intercept!
They ignored us?
Are they Aberrants?
Three are breaking through!
Captain Levi!
You just did something, \Ndidn't you, bitch?
So they're after the Female Titan?
Titans from all directions!
All men, engage.
Defend the Female Titan, \Neven if it means your lives!
It's no use!
Retreat, men!
Back into formation!
Return to Karanes!
We've been had.
Just look at you.
Don't tell me...
The enemy
was willing to sacrifice everything.
I didn't expect the enemy to destroy \Nitself along with the evidence
by making Titans devour itself.
All our talk at the court martial, \Nand this is what happens.
If we return empty-handed, who knows
\Nwhat will happen to Eren or us.
We can think about that after we return.
Our priority now is getting home \Nwithout additional casualties.
For now...
The steam from the corpse is limiting visibility.
It could interfere with our signal \Nflare message relay system.
I'll call my team.
Wait, Levi...
Refill your gas and blades.
There isn't time.
I think I have plenty.
Why?
That's an order.
Follow it.
Roger, Erwin.
I trust your decision.
We're retreating.
Everyone, retreat.
Get back on your horse, and retreat.
Right!
What? It's already over?
We can go home! All right!
What's going on?
Where's Eren?
Looks like it's over.
Back to the horses! Prepare to retreat!
You heard the man...
Let's go see what the \Nbastard inside looks like.
Will we really find out who it is?
It's thanks to you.
I didn't really do anything.
You had faith in us.
This is the result of your choice \Nto trust us back then.
Making the right choice isn't easy.
Hey, don't spoil him, Petra...
What did he do, anyway?
He was pathetic. He just kept whining.
Well, coming back alive on your \Nfirst excursion is pretty good.
But it doesn't count \Nuntil the mission's over.
Listen, kiddo, the expedition lasts \Nuntil you're at home in bed...
Jeez, I know that!
Oluo! Petra!
You guys pissed your pants and \Ncried on your first mission.
You're all grown up now!
Don't say that!
What if he stops respecting me?!
It's true?
It sure is.
And I didn't, by the way, Eren.
Idiot!
I've killed more of them than you!
More of them than you, idiot!
Kill count isn't all \Nthat makes a soldier.
Shut up, idiot!
Petra...
Does that mean you sprayed \Nit everywhere while mid-air?
Shut up!
Do you think you're on a picnic?
We're outside the walls!
I didn't piss my pants, either, Eren.
Oh, I'm sure that's the \Nsignal from Captain Levi.
We'll rendezvous with the Captain!
Cut the chatter till we get back.
Erwin...
Why did you order Levi to resupply?
There's no time to waste.
The Female Titan was eaten.
But did you see the \Nperson inside get eaten?
I didn't.
You can't mean...
Yes...
If your original hypothesis was correct,
and they can still move to a degree \Nafter regaining human form...
And if they'd equipped \NManeuver Gear in advance...
The one within the Female Titan \Nis wearing our uniform right now.
Captain Levi?
No, it's not!
Who are you?!
G-Gunther!
What? Why?
Gunther!
The enemy is now camouflaged \Nas one of our men.
The capture operation has failed.
The Female Titan appears \Nbefore Eren once more.
What stands between it and its target
are the master Titan killers,
the Special Ops Squad.
