We will now begin the 57th \Nexpedition beyond the walls!
Onward!
The Survey Corps left to \Nfind a route to Zhiganshina,
but encountered a Female Titan,
a transformed human like Eren.
That's no Aberrant.
It's a human in the body of a Titan!
As soldiers died, one after the next,
they headed into a \Nforest of giant trees,
none of them knowing why.
If Squad Levi doesn't \Ndefeat it, who will?
Choose.
Believe in yourself.
Or believe in the Survey Corps and me.
I'll go forward!
Fire!
Oh, right...
I wanted to ask you something.
Is it okay if we cut off \Nyour hands and legs?
They'll grow back, right?
I'm talking about {\i1}your {\i0}\Nlimbs, not the Titan's.
We need you alive, after all...
The enemy was willing \Nto sacrifice everything.
I didn't expect the enemy to destroy \Nitself along with the evidence
by making Titans devour itself.
Retreat, men!
Back into formation!
Return to Karanes!
Erwin...
Why did you order Levi to resupply?
There's no time to waste.
The Female Titan was eaten.
But did you see the \Nperson inside get eaten?
I didn't.
You can't mean...
Yes...
If your original hypothesis was correct,
and they can still move to a degree \Nafter regaining human form...
And if they'd equipped \NManeuver Gear in advance...
The one within the Female Titan \Nis wearing our uniform right now.
Captain Levi?
No, it's not!
Who are you?!
Gunther!
The enemy is now camouflaged \Nas one of our men.
Crushing Blow \N57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (5)
When the Colossal Titan vanished,
whoever was inside had been \Nwearing Maneuver Gear,
so that they could escape in the steam.
Don't you think the same \Npossibility applies here?
But at the time...
Based on what we saw when Eren \Nemerged from the Titan,
we concluded it would be impossible.
His equipment was destroyed, \Nand his uniform was gone.
Above all, Eren was so weak, \Nhe couldn't even stand unassisted.
The Female Titan was able to \Nattract other Titans with its cry.
We failed to predict this, \Nand the operation failed.
If Titan abilities vary \Ndepending on skill,
it was a mistake to use Eren, a total novice, \Nas the basis for our assumptions.
If we are to outwit our enemy, \Nwe'll need to think outside the box.
If we're withdrawing, does that \Nmean the mission succeeded?
If so, then we may already know who \Nwas inside the Female Titan.
I'd like to see who it is...
But why was the Commander so sure
that the enemy would come after \NEren if he left the walls?
I think it's because, for some reason,
they suddenly stopped their advance \Nin the midst of the last assault.
Even though they managed \Nto break through Trost's gate,
they didn't even try for the inner gate.
And when Eren sealed \Nthe gate, they let him.
It could mean that they now \Nhave bigger concerns...
Bigger concerns?
Something more important to \Nthem than breaching the walls.
Something unexpected that happened.
Eren's transformation into a Titan?!
I think it's the only answer.
Then... That means...
Wait... So...
Someone who was there, \Nwho saw Eren transform,
is the Titan.
Gunther!
Eren, don't stop!
Onward!
But Gunther...
Who's there?
Protect Eren!
Damn it, what do we do?
Eldo, where should we go?
There isn't time to reach the horses!
Head for HQ, as fast as you can!
Is it from the Female Titan? \NOr is there more than one?
Damn you...
How dare you?!
Come at me!
I'll defeat you, even if it kills me!
The Female Titan?
Impossible... Why?
Didn't we catch it?!
If the enemy has some way \Nto retain its strength,
it may be able to transform once more.
I knew it...
It's coming!
The Female Titan!
Damn you...
How dare you!
This time, I will defeat it!
No!
The three of us will \Nkill the Female Titan.
You will continue to head \Nstraight for HQ at top speed!
Here's what I have gleaned \Nfrom this battle...
If we only focus on \Nmaking the best moves,
we will never get the \Nbetter of our opponent.
When necessary, we must be \Nwilling to take big risks,
and be prepared to lose everything.
I'll fight, too!
No!
This is the best move...
Your power is too risky!
What? Do you doubt us?
Do you, Eren?
Do you find it that hard to trust us?
Unless we change how we fight,
humanity cannot win!
I believe my squad will be victorious.
Good luck!
We took its sight.
For at least a minute, \Nit'll be in total darkness!
Kill it during this time!
Screw capturing it...
Kill it now!
Die here without honor!
Make that bitch of a Titan pay!
We won't let your eyes regenerate!
We'll shear off so much muscle \Naround your shoulders,
you won't be able to keep your arms up!
Shear it off...
Make its arms...
...fall!
They're down!
Now the neck!
Shear off the muscles \Nthat support its neck!
And we can strike its weak point!
They're so strong.
The Female Titan is \Ntotally on the defensive.
How can they launch co-op attacks like that\Nwithout even speaking to each other?
I bet it's only possible because \Nthey believe in one another.
They've overcome many \Nhardships that way.
That's why they're so strong, \Neven right after losing Gunther.
I'll go forward...
If I go forward and believe in them, \Nwithout turning back, then...
I'm sure that's the right answer.
I finally understand!
I don't know...
I never have.
I can believe in my own abilities
or the choices of companions I trust.
But no one ever knows \Nhow it will turn out.
Strike the neck, now!
Eldo!
H-How?
It can't possibly see!
It hasn't even been thirty seconds...
Only one eye?
It prioritized one eye \Nto accelerate the healing...
Is that even possible?
Petra!
We need to regroup!
Petra, now!
Hey...
Die!
How?
My blade can't pierce it...
I...
I will...
I'll kill it!
Eren?
Wait, what? Mikasa?
That voice... Don't tell me...
Information We Can Share So Far:
Survey Corps Horses (1) \NThe horses of the Survey Corps were bred \Nspecifically for them, and stand around \N160 cm, weighing between 450 and 500 kg.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Survey Corps Horses (2) \NTheir top speed is between 75 and 80 km/h, \Nand they can maintain speeds of 35 km/h. \NHorses are about the only way to escape a Titan.
I made the wrong choice...
I wanted to believe in my companions...
Because of that, everyone died!
If I had believed in myself \Nfrom the start and fought...
If I'd only killed it at the beginning!
Back then,
if I'd turned into a Titan...
No...
If I'd fought
even before that...
Captain Levi was there, too.
We would have won.
Maybe we could've captured it.
You aren't wrong.
{\fad(1,229)}If you want to, do it.
I...
I made a choice.
And it killed everyone.
It's my fault they died.
But despite all that...
It's still your fault!
I'll tear you apart...
Once my hand heals,
I'll rip you apart... \NTear you to shreds...
Rip you into tiny pieces...
And eat you!
Eren!
W-Wait... Eren...
Don't go...
Give...
Give...
Give Eren back!
Give him back!
Give him back!
Why won't my blade penetrate?
I know that
he's alive...
I know that Eren's alive!
No matter where she goes, I'll kill her,
rip her apart,
and get you out of that filth.
I'm sorry, Eren...
Just wait a little longer...
Wait!
Wh-What are you...
Fall back for now.
Maintain this distance.
It may be tired.
It does not appear to \Nbe going very fast.
He seems to have been bit \Nright out of the neck.
Is Eren dead?
"Eren is alive."
"Give Eren back."
The Female Titan took Eren from \NMikasa before her very eyes.
Mikasa joins forces with humanity's \Nstrongest fighter, Levi,
to challenge the Female Titan to battle.
