You had your time, but it's over!
Look above you, morons!
Where are Eren and Christa?
It's no use!
If you don't turn yourselves in, every last\NScout we captured will get the noose!
I entrusted something to Commander Pyxis.
When it comes, I will only watch.
It's up to you to decide.
You... and them.
"Reply"
That sure is a lot of wagons.
What's going on?
You don't know?
Right now, all the heads of the\Nmilitary are meeting inside the castle
to finally dismantle the Scout Regiment.
See?
There's the gallows for\Nhanging their commander.
I bet it's ongoing as we speak...\Nhis final judgment.
If humanity loses the Scout Regiment,\Nthat means humanity loses their spear.
When enemies close in, you guard not with a\Nshield, but a spear that eliminates the threat.
Suppose now, if this instant,\NWall Rose were to be breached...
The residents of Wall Rose would again\Nflee and take refuge in Wall Sina.
But the earlier evacuation left stockpiles\Nwith no more than a few days at best.
In the blink of an eye, most of the residents\Nwould be forced to fight for survival.
Wall Rose and Sina... Humanity would be split\Nin two factions and civil war would erupt.
Even if the wall was not breached, Wall Rose\Nis continually suffering a food shortage.
It may not be Titans that breach Wall Sina...
There's a chance the residents\Nof Wall Rose do it first.
Reclaim Wall Maria.
If humanity is to ever hope for\Na future, that is the only way.
Are you implying that the Scouts\Nare needed for such a cause?
Our duty as Scouts has always been\Nto charge forth at the enemy.
Cowering away will not solve anything.
Or could it be... you have some sort\Nof secret plan to overcome this ordeal?
Erwin, I don't think you understand.
The reason you're here today is not\Nto discuss our future within the walls,
nor is it because of something\Nas simple as murder.
Clause Six, Charter of Humanity.
"Thou shall not prioritize one's own\Ngain over the longevity of humanity."
You're here for this grave offense.
Indeed. You've refused to hand\Nover Eren Jaeger multiple times.
In doing so, you've violated the Charter.
But Eren is vital for reclaiming Wall Maria!
That is not for the Scouts to decide!
Eren Jaeger is a Titan whose\Npowers are not understood!
Sheltering him within the walls\Nis a risk to humanity!
It's absurd for a single commander\Nto have control of him alone.
And yet, you stubbornly persisted\Nin some plan of yours.
Not only did you feign his abduction\Nand conceal Eren Jaeger...
...but you silenced Dimo Reeves\Nsince he knew of your plans.
This is clearly treason.
It is not a stretch to say that\Nyou're the threat to humanity.
Commander Pyxis.
Hmm?
The Garrison and Scout Regiments\Nboth risk their lives on the front lines.
How are we to know that\Nyou're not his comrade?
I'm quite disturbed that you believe\Nwe would align ourselves with the Scouts.
Nothing is more senseless\Nthan humans killing humans.
In this cramped world that we humans have,\None spark will engulf all in no time.
When it came time to defend Trost District,
that's what I told my soldiers\Nbefore sending many to their deaths.
If the Scout Regiment is that one spark,\Nit should be smothered at once.
After all, if the Titans do manage to break
the wall and find hardly anyone left inside...
...those poor Titans might go hungry.
Very well.
Allow us to discuss.
Your Majesty... May we?
Erwin... Is this how you want it to end?!
In the name of the King,\NI will announce your judgment.
Erwin Smith.
For violating Clause Six of the Charter of Humanity,
you are sentenced to death.
Your execution will be carried out immediately.
Take him.
Is this what you wanted, Erwin?!
With this, you're...
Wall Rose...
...has been breached!
The Colossal Titan appeared out of nowhere!
Along with the Armored Titan, they broke\Nthrough both gates of Calaneth District!
Currently, refugees from the East\Nare flocking here for safety!
Establish a route for the evacuees!
Have all Garrison troops\Nconverge and defend the East!
Get the evacuees safely to Wall Sina!
Everyone, hurry! Saving the\Nevacuees is our top priority!
--Sir!
--No!\N--Sir!
Hmm?
Close up all of the gates to Wall Sina!
Don't let a single refugee inside!
Huh?!
B-But that's... all the Wall Rose residents?
Your command is to sit back and\Nwatch as half of humanity dies?
It's just like he said earlier!\NThat's asking for civil war!
We can't let the government lose control!\NIf that happens, it's over!
B-But... That's only a mere possibility!
It's enough for that possibility to exist!
Our authority is and always will be absolute!
Now, get moving!
Shit...
To think the wall would be\Nbreached at a time like this...
Though, there is a silver lining.
We've already found the power.
All that's left is to bide our time\Nuntil the vessel takes it.
That's right. There's no need to be\Nflustered by this little disaster.
As long as Wall Sina holds up, we'll be fine.
Yes, once Lord Reiss comes back...
Let's do it! Close the gates!
Wait!
It'll be too late if we wait!
Who gets to choose?
Who decides?
What are you doing?! Hurry it up!
It'll be treason if you don't!
I will not!
What?!
Hey...
I... am a human of Wall Rose!
I will not allow the gates to be closed!
You fool!
I will stand behind him.
Dhalis Zachary...
Are you surprised at all by\Ntheir reaction, Premier Zachary?
No... Not a bit.
Zachary, what's the meaning of this?!
That report just now was a false alarm.
Rest assured.
At the moment, there has been\Nno report of a Titan attack.
You bastards! What is this farce?!
If you want the mastermind, it's me.
Pyxis?!
It seems most of the Interior Police\Nare off somewhere or other.
I suppose that's quite fortunate.
What do you mean?!
Earlier, I declared to you that the Garrison\NRegiment isn't aligned with the Scout Regiment.
But I did forget to mention one thing...
I'm not aligned with any of you either.
While I do possess some of the\Nsame feelings as Erwin here...
...I considered leaving things\Nup to your government
if that were the better choice\Nfor the sake of humanity.
You are, after all, much wiser than us\Nwhen it comes to Titans and the walls.
Supposing you actually cared about\Nsaving as many people as possible,
I would have been fine\Nsending Erwin to the gallows.
Of course, depending on your decision,\Nall of us were prepared to forfeit our heads.
However, the answer you've\Ngiven us is very clear!
We may be ignorant about the Titans\Nand their powers, but...
I daresay, we in our ignorance can save\Nfar more people than you ever could!
Y-You're a fool! What do you think\Nundermining us will accomplish?!
The citizens will never listen to you!
They'll obey whatever the crown says!
The regional lords will have none of this!
It seems you don't quite understand.
This is no mere threat.
It's a coup d'état.
We've successfully restrained\Nthe Interior Police!
Mmm.
The thing with soldiers, they'll obey\Ntheir superior officer over the king.
Especially when the king in question is a fraud.
We will put in place a new ruler of our own.
It can't be... They're actually...
Don't even think you can\Nget away with this hoax!
If that disaster had in fact happened...
The decision that all of you made violates\NClause Six of the Charter of Humanity.
Furthermore, is installing a fake king
to personally control and run the\Ngovernment not punishable by death?
Shit! Wake up, dotard!
What? Time to eat?
Shut up, you useless oaf!
Erwin...
This is your victory.
Aren't you happy?
Nile.
Humanity has just begun down a new path...
One far more dangerous than before.
And there you have it.\NThe coup d'état was successful.
Premier Zachary has control of\Nthe capital and administrative district.
For the time being, the nobility hasn't rebelled.
What about the Boss Reeves incident?
We got a confession that proved\Nthe charges unfounded.
His son Flegel really pulled through big time.
Don't you get it?!
The government doesn't give\Na shit about saving any of us!
Face the truth now, because it'll be\Ntoo late when you're dead!
That's right! If Titans attack us again,\Nthere'll be nothing left this time!
Not the company! Not our families!
Let's print the truth before that happens!
Just like it's written right there, it shows the\Ncharges were bogus, they abused their power,
and that King Fritz was a total fake.
All our actions were justified self-defense.
In other words, we're free people now.
Woohoo!
No... This can't be...
Looks like the gamble paid off.
Yeah.
It wasn't just Erwin though.
The lone choices of many\Nmanaged to change the world.
And I managed to kill the\Nthree people you loaned me.
I'm sorry.
The thing is, part of the Interior Police,
their leader, Eren, and Historia are somewhere else.
If we don't find them soon...
I may have a clue about that.
Let's get there and put an end to this battle.
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"\N"Underground Chapel"\N"A sacred location where the royal family's power has been passed down for generations. The walls are composed of a naturally luminescent ore which is thought to have been created by some form of Titan power."
As a result of Erwin's actions,
it was declared that the current\Nregime would be ousted.
That announcement came immediately after
the military gained control of the\Ncapital and administrative district.
And took place upon the gallows\Nconstructed specifically for him.
That's right.
It's exactly how Premier Zachary\Nexplained in the speech.
Understand that our goal\Nis not to establish military rule.
In place of Fritz, a new ruler will\Ncome from the true royal family.
They will be the one responsible\Nfor leading the people.
I understand that well enough,
but do you really think people will simply\Naccept a new ruler just like that?
There're a lot of citizens out\Nthere who are very worried.
At this point, who do we trust?
As far as humanity's concerned,
we should have let the government do as they please.
Like Commander Pyxis was saying,
they've somehow devised a means\Nof keeping humanity alive until now.
Even if they watch as half of humanity dies,\Nit's better than us going extinct.
Should I have let Eren go, risked my comrade's\Nlives, given up both my life and my duty,
and entrusted it all to the government?
If humanity is more precious\Nthan one single life...
Your duty is as painful as ever.
Dying seems a far easier option.
In that case, why didn't you do as you say?
That's...
Shall I tell you my reason?
For a long time, I've hated those bastards!
Huh?
They piss me off!
Those pompous pricks and pigs\Nwho think they're important...
No... Maybe I actually liked them.
I've been dreaming for\Nthis day to come for ages.
That is... Even if you hadn't done it, I would've\Ngiven it a shot before I kicked the bucket.
I couldn't care less if this coup d'état\Nis good or bad for humanity.
I'm quite the scoundrel, right?
But you're no different than me.
You didn't want to die.
Just like me, you prioritize yourself\Nover the fate of humanity.
I... must be very conceited to think that.
What's your reason?
Now it's your turn to answer.
I...
...have a dream.
One I've had since I was a child...
Hange.
You might know where they are?
Yeah, I'll explain.
Erwin gave me this Scout investigation\Nreport regarding Lord Reiss' land.
Most of it has to do with an incident five\Nyears ago that shook up the Reiss family.
Five years ago?
Right. On the day Wall Maria was breached.
I'll summarize the important\Nbits from the beginning.
As the lord of his territory, popular opinion\Nof Rod Reiss wasn't all that bad.
He had five children, and his eldest\Ndaughter Frieda was a down-to-earth girl
that even the peasants adored.
But that night, five years ago, disaster struck.
With the world having plunged into pure chaos,
some bandits raided and set fire\Nto the only chapel around.
Unfortunately, that night, the entire\NReiss family was there praying together.
And so, the whole family, save for\Nthe head of the house, Rod Reiss...
...was massacred that night by the bandits.
To top it off, this incident occurred\Njust a few days before Historia's mother
was killed by the Interior Police.
In other words, immediately after losing\Nhis family, Rod Reiss sought out Historia.
There must be a reason he\Nand his lackeys are after Historia.
The same bloodline?
Is there some secret to their blood?
I don't know for sure yet.
But what really makes me curious is that\Nparts of the chapel are completely wrecked.
The chapel itself is stone. It would take\Ntons of time and effort to destroy it.
Bandits would take what they can\Nand make a quick escape.
Plus, the only one who saw those\Nbandits was Rod Reiss himself.
Soon after, he used his own\Nfortune to rebuild the chapel.
But why?
If you think about it, it's actually stranger\Nthat there were no traces of Titans.
Even if I'm jumping to conclusions,
something this suspicious deserves us checking it out.
What the hell?!
Before the night is over,\Nwe'll have soldiers all over Reiss' land.
Unfortunately, I doubt\Nhe'll be waiting that long.
If we don't hurry and get there,\NEren may end up being eaten.
If a Titan eats a person who can change into\Na Titan and thus inherits their powers...
If that's actually true...
When and how did Eren become a Titan,\Nand who did he eat to gain his powers?
Shit!
Historia?
To save Eren, Mikasa and the\Nothers head for the Reiss chapel.
However, the captured Eren finds out...
...his father, Grisha's, unforgivable sin.
