Go, Eren!
In the year 850...
For the first time,
humanity recovered part of its  territory from the Titans.
Though at great cost.
Then I welcome everyone  here to the Survey Corps!
This is a true salute!
Offer up your hearts!
Yes, sir!
You have done well to endure your fear.
You are brave soldiers.
You have my heartfelt respect.
A month later,
led by Erwin Smith, the Survey Corps left Karanes
to find a route to Zhiganshina,
where it's believed the secrets  of the Titans are held.
We will now begin the 57th  expedition beyond the walls!
Onward!
Female Titan  57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (1)
Ahead, to the left, a 10-meter class!
I am very interested in seeing  what's inside its stomach...
But I'll leave it to the support team!
Damn!
Not deep enough.
Defend the formation!
Stay strong!
Leave it to the support team, and keep going!
Onward! Onward!
The support teams will only  accompany us to the old city area.
Once we're past that,  it's completely Titan territory.
The long-range scouting formation devised  by Commander Erwin is our only hope.
We, the special ops squad, are here.
Sir, can they...
Can my classmates beat the Titans?
Huh?
What have you been doing the past month?
Listen, brat...
The most crucial part
of an expedition is in how  you avoid fighting Titansâ€”
Go into long-range scouting formation!
See ya, Armin.
If you run into a Titan, don't piss your pants!
Right!
Same to you, Jean.
Row 3-3: Relay
The vanguard is to spread out in a semi-circle.
But stay within visual range of one another.
Row 5-Center: Standby
Position yourselves at fixed intervals.
Row 2-5: Relay
Extend the recon and message relay  range as far as possible.
Row 3-4: Relay
Row 2-4: Relay
We'll be fine...
Calm down!
It's primarily the forward recon squad  that will encounter Titans.
Row 1-8: Recon
As soon as one is sighted,  they'll fire a red smoke round.
Anyone who sees the flare should fire  the same round to relay the signal.
Row 2-Center: Command
When the Commander sees it,
he'll fire a green smoke round,
and show the formation where to go.
Thus, the entire formation can advance
toward the goal, while avoiding Titans.
Row 2-3: Relay
But sometimes, due to terrain or obstacles,
a Titan won't be sighted until  it's within the formation.
Red... Red...
Red smoke round...
Blause! Over here!
Damn it! Did we let one through?
We'll draw it this way.
Blause, get over here!
I'll handle it!
Split off!
Yes, sir!
Sir...
Back into position!
He ran out of gas.
Something's wrong...
It's been a while since we saw the red smoke round,
but they still haven't reformed.
It can't be...
Note that this strategy only works on normal Titans,
whose behavior can be easily predicted.
A black smoke round?
Is a Titan ignoring the nearby humans
and heading for the formation's center?
It has to be...
That's
an Aberrant!
It's only necessary to fight Aberrants,
whose behavior is unpredictable.
Damn, we'll have to fight it...
Sys, go for the neck!
I'll stop it!
Roger!
Using Maneuver Gear on flat  terrain is a huge disadvantage.
It almost never works.
But I can't let it disrupt the formation.
I think that's Arlert over there.
I don't want one of the  new guys to run into it.
We kill it here!
Now, Sys!
You did it, Squad Leader Ness!
Did I get him?
You came for me?
That's my partner...
I love you, Shallot!
Again?
What is the right flank recon squad doing?
If it ignored them and came this way,
it must be another Aberrant.
Oh, fine...
Sys, we do it again.
Right.
But we've got the worst luck,  doing this twice in a row...
And I think it's at least a fourteen-meter class.
This one will be tough.
What's that?
It's too fast!
Don't let it reach Arlert!
Sys!
Right!
No... No.
That's no Aberrant.
It's intelligent!
Like the Armored or Colossal Titans, or Eren...
A human in the body of a Titan!
B-But who?
Why?
This is bad! What should I do?
I'm going to die, too...
I'll be killed!
Go! Run!
What does it...
No, what do they...
What do they want?
Information We Can Share So Far:
Long-Range Scouting Formation (1)  Devised by Survey Corps Commander  Erwin Smith, its use has dramatically  increased survival rates outside the walls.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Long Range Scouting Formation (2)  Put simply, it's a form of human "radar." By quickly  alerting Erwin in the center to the discovery of  any Titans, the Survey Corps can change course.
Someone tell them...
That the right flank recon squad  has been wiped out...
A Female Titan brought  a huge Titan army!
Is anyone there?
It's not going to kill me?
Why?
It removed my hood...
To... To look at my face?
Armin!
Reiner!
Hey, can you stand?
You won't last outside the walls  unless you're on horseback...
Hurry!
Right!
I saw the smoke round signaling an Aberrant.
Was it that one there with the nice ass?
That's no Aberrant...
It's a human in a Titan body!
What was that?
Wait a second.
We need to fire a smoke round first.
H-Hurry...
There's an emergency over there.
With a smoke round, I'll...
Wait... I think Jean fired it.
It came from the right flank.
Does that mean we're so compromised,  we can't continue the mission?
Looks like the right flank recon  squad was partially wiped out...
Titans, tons of them.
I don't know why,
but there are lots of fast ones.
For now, we're holding them back,
but recon is no longer possible...
We've taken heavy losses,
and if we aren't careful, we'll be destroyed!
That Titan came from the same direction.
No way...
Was it leading the Titans?
It?
Why is a Titan over there?
An Aberrant?
No, it's a human in a Titan body...
Someone with the same ability as Eren.
What?
Why do you think that, Armin?
The Titans only eat us.
We're just killed in the process.
Killing us isn't ever specifically their goal.
But when Sys aimed for its weak spot,
it crushed him and smashed him into the ground.
It killed him to kill, rather than to eat him.
Its nature is different from the others.
When the Colossal and Armored  Titans destroyed the walls,
it must've been the one that  brought that army of Titans.
Their goal has consistently been to attack all humanity!
No, maybe not.
It felt like it was looking for someone...
If that is the case,  could it be looking for...
Could it be looking for Eren?
Eren?
Eren's with Squad Levi, which is  in charge of the right flank.
The right flank?
The plans I got had them  to the rear of the left flank.
Mine said they were near  the front of the right...
Wait, there's no way they'd  be on the front lines.
So where are they?
Probably the safest place in the formation.
Which means in the center,  and toward the rear...
Armin!
There's no time to think.
Smoke rounds can't possibly indicate  how much of a threat it poses!
At this rate, it'll wipe out command.
Then the formation will fall apart,  and that'll be the end.
What are you trying to say?
In other words,
at this range, we may still be  able to draw its attention.
We may be able to buy time to withdraw.
Maybe... Maybe...
But it really is intelligent.
To it, we are nothing but insignificant insects.
It'll just crush us...
Seriously?
That's scary...
Hey, are you really Jean?
The Jean I know never thinks  of anyone but himself.
Don't be an ass...
I just don't want those charred bones I saw
to be disappointed in me!
I...
I know what I have to do now!
And this is the job we chose.
Help me!
Put on your hood.
As far forward as you can...
So that your face is hidden from it.
I don't think it will kill us until  it knows who we are!
Oh...
You believe if it thinks we might  be Eren, it won't kill us?
If nothing else, it'll make me feel better.
Let's just hope it has poor eyesight!
Armin, I thought it was creepy  how you always clung to Eren.
But I've always thought you had it in you.
Uh, thanks.
But "creepy"? That's really mean...
It's going much more slowly  than when I first saw it.
Is it tired?
If it runs at that speed again, we'll be too late!
Now's our chance... We have to do it now!
Listen up... Remember what I said.
Try to draw its attention  for as long as possible,
to give the formation time to withdraw!
Keep it here as long as you can.
If we could cut its Achilles tendon,  that'd be more than enough.
But don't do anything stupid...
Don't try to kill it!
It's aware of the weak spot on its neck.
It's totally different than other Titans...
It is impossible to kill.
At least, not by any normal human being.
However...
If it's those two... Maybe...
Armin!
This one...
Its movements are much more  precise than the others' are!
Damn it.
I...
I underestimated it!
It protected its neck...
Jean!
Damn it! I can't get away!
I'm going to die!
Once it grasps my wire, it's over!
Jean!
Avenge the suicidal bastard!
Armin?
It stopped?
That's the one...
That's the one that killed him!
He rushed to his death on the right flank!
Avenge him!
What happened?
Did Armin hit his head and go insane?
This isn't the time...
R-Reiner?
It crushed my best friend!
I saw his body under its foot!
He's going straight for the neck?
No, it's working!
While it's distracted by Armin!
H-Hey...
H-Hey... Reiner, you...
Reiner did it!
Mikasa was so strong, I forgot.
But he's really strong and reliable, too...
We've bought enough time, right?
Let's get the hell away from it!
If it isn't a man-eater, it won't follow us!
Look...
That big bitch got scared  and decided to go home!
No... Why?
That's toward the center rear.
Is it
heading toward Eren?
"You monster..."
Even highly trained members of the Survey Corps
are unable to stop the Female Titan.
The monster finally catches sight  of Eren in a forest of giant trees.
Forest of Giant Trees  57th Expedition Beyond the Walls(2)
