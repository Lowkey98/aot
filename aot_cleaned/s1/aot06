The World the Girl Saw  Battle for Trost (2)
Hey!
Hey! What's wrong, Armin?
Wake up!
Hey!
Armin...
Come on, Armin!
Come on!
Are you awake?
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
What about your team?
Team?
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Why are you alone?
And what's this weird slime on you?
What happened?
You useless idiot!
D-Die!
Hey...
Calm down, Armin!
Where is everyone?
That's enough, Connie.
They were all wiped out...
All except for him.
Shut up!
Armin didn't say anything about that!
Just look around you...
We don't have any more  time to waste on him.
Why is Armin the only one who made it?
Who knows.
Maybe they thought he was already dead?
It's unfortunate that they ran into multiple Titans.
What a shame that only this loser survived  instead of Eren and the others.
Want me to shut that mouth forever, bitch?!
Stop it, both of you!
No one's thinking straight...
All of our friends are dying so fast.
It would freak anyone out!
That's my Krista.
Once this operation ends, marry me!
Sure...
Her antics are even more off the charts than usual.
Anyway, we can't leave you here.
Can you stand, Armin?
S-Sorry for causing trouble.
I'll go meet up with the rearguard.
Wait...
Armin!
Let's go, Connie!
We have orders to advance!
This is hell.
No, it was always hell.
I just never realized it.
This world has always been hell.
The strong devour the weak.
It's almost as if the world's doing us a favor  by making it so easy to understand.
But, my friends...
They tried to be strong in this world.
They helped me, who was weak.
I couldn't stand that...
To those two, I'm someone  who needs protecting.
I wanted to be strong like them.
To live in this world as their equal!
And this is the result...
Eren died because of me.
Hannah, what are you doing?
Help me, Armin!
Franz isn't breathing!
I keep performing CPR, but he won't...
Franz won't...
Hannah, it's dangerous down here.  Get up on the roof—
I can't just leave him here!
But, Hannah...
Franz is...
Stop it, please...
No more!
I can't take any more...
Hey, do you people have any idea  what situation we're in?
I do, and that's why we're doing this!
If you want to live, help us!
Screw you!
You can't fit that through!
You should let the people through first!
The Titans will eat all of us!
What are you doing, soldiers?
Arrest them!
B-But...
Try it, peon.
I'm boss of the guild here.
Well...
Who do you think paid for all the  food you soldiers crapped out?
Can you get enough money to feed  all the soldiers in this city?
The rest of you, help push!
The stuff in here's worth more
than you'll ever earn in your worthless lives!
Help out, and I'll pay you!
It's okay...
Dad will get the Titans with his cannon.
Mom...
Look.
Push!
If you don't want to die, push!
Please! My child!
Damn it! Why is it ignoring us?
It's an Aberrant!
No point in thinking about it.
It's fast...
We're the best around,  and we still can't catch up!
At this rate...
What are you doing?
Perfect!
You there! Make them help us!
We'll pay you well!
Right now,
my friends are dying.
Because the people haven't evacuated,
they're dying, fighting the Titans.
Of course!
It's your job to sacrifice yourselves
to protect the people's lives and fortunes.
You parasites think you're so special  just because you're finally being useful
for the first time in a century?!
If you expect someone to die  for the sake of another as a matter of course,
I'm sure you'll understand this.
That sometimes a single,  noble sacrifice can save many lives.
Try it!
I've known your boss for a long time...
I can decide your fate with a single word!
How is a corpse going to talk?
Wait!
B-Boss...
Pull the wagon back.
We're saved!
Thank you!
You saved us.
Thank you!
Well done, Ackerman...
I'm impressed.
Thank you, sir.
However,
I was in too much of a hurry.  I ruined my blades in that one strike.
Next time, I'll be more careful.
What happened to you before all this?
No, never mind.
Why would I remember that now?

It's done!
Look, Mom!
Oh, good job, Mikasa.
It's wonderful.
This embroidery pattern has been passed  down in our family for generations.
When you have children of your own,  teach it to them.
How do you get children?
Hmm...
Ask your dad.
Hey, Dad...
Uh, well... Your dad isn't too sure, either...
Oh, Doctor Jaeger's on his way over.  Maybe you should ask him.
Oh!
Looks like he's here.
Coming!
Mikasa?
That's right.
A girl your age.
There aren't any children around here.
Be nice to her.
Depends on how she acts toward me.
Eren...
This is why you only have one friend.
Are they not here?
Mister Ackerman, it's me, Jaeger.
Excuse us...
What's wrong?
Hey... Dad?
She's gone.
Eren, did you see a girl around here?
Have you seen Mikasa?
No.
All right...
I'm going to call the Military Police  and request a search.
You wait at the base of the mountain.
Understand, Eren?
Eren?
Hey...
Can we really sell her?
We killed her parents to get her.
Take a good look at her face.
She's a looker, but she's still a kid.
Not my type.
I wasn't asking about your type.
She's Asian.
Humans used to have races, too...
She's the last descendant
of a clan that fled from a place called "Asia"  to take refuge within the walls.
We'll take her to the capital's underworld  and auction her off to perverts.
The rest of the Asians went extinct...
She'll fetch a high price.
Her father didn't look Asian.
She isn't a pure-blood.
That's right...
The mother was the one really worth something!
And you got scared and killed her!
I h-had to... She was putting up a fight!
Is that all you have to say? Huh?!
Doctor Jaeger, we've been waiting for—
Excuse us.
Stay put if you don't want me  to split your head wide open.
You bitch!
Mikasa, run!
Mom...
Hurry, Mikasa!
Um...
Dad...
Damn it!
Stop struggling!
What are you doing?
I said to just kill the father!
But the bitch...
No excuses...
Grab the girl!
Hey, you'd better not put up a fight.
Or you know what'll happen!
It's so cold...
Excuse me.
Hey, kid!
How did you find us?
Um, I got lost in the forest,  and I saw this house...
A child shouldn't go walking  all alone through the forest...
There are scary wolves in the forest.
But now you don't need to worry!
Just come with us, and...
Thanks, mister.
I've learned my lesson.
Die, asshole!
You're kidding me!
Wait, you damn brat!
You animals!
Die! Die!
This is what you get!
This is what you deserve!
Don't try to stand up again!
It's safe now...
Don't worry.
You're Mikasa, right?
I'm Eren.
Doctor Jaeger's son.
You've met my dad.
My dad and I came to your  house for the checkup.
And then...
There were three of them.
Did you do this?
Did you kill them? Did you?!
I'll kill you... I'll kill you!
Fight...
Fight!
If we don't win...
We'll die...
If we win, we'll live!
What are you thinking, you stupid brat?
If we don't fight, we can't win!
But I can't...
And that was when I remembered...
I'd seen this before...
so very many times.
I'd seen it again and again,
but...
I'd always pretended I hadn't.
That's right.
This world
is cruel.
In that instant, my body stopped shaking.
And from then on, I was in  complete control of myself.
I thought I could do anything.
Fight...
Fight!
Fight!
A single stab to the heart from behind.
Those children did this?
Eren, I told you to wait at  the base of the mountain.
Do you understand what you've done?
I got rid of dangerous animals...
Animals that happened to resemble humans!
Eren!
They would've been long gone  by the time the police arrived.
They wouldn't have got here in time!
Even if that's true,  you were just plain lucky, Eren!
I'm mad because you risked  your life without thinking!
But I wanted to save her  as soon as I could...
Do you remember me, Mikasa?
When you were young,  we met several times.
Doctor Jaeger...
Which way should I go...
to get home from here?
It's cold...
I don't have
anywhere to go home to.
You can have this.
It's warm, isn't it?
It's warm.
Mikasa, come live with us.
You've been through a lot...
You need lots of rest.
What is it?
Come on, let's go back.
Let's go back to our home.
Okay, let's go home.
A cruel world, in which  only the victor survives.
Pull back, Ackerman.
We'll climb the wall.
I'll help the vanguard withdraw.
Wait, Ackerman!
But in this world,
I have somewhere to go home to.
Eren...
As long as I have you,
I can do anything.
"I have somewhere to go home to."
After completing her mission with the rear guard,
Mikasa hurries back to Eren.
But instead, she is told
that Eren has died.
