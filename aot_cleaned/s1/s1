In the year 845...
the Colossal and Armored Titans
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,
along with the life we'd known.
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,
losing twenty percent of its population  and a third of its territory,
to retreat within Wall Rose.
Now, in the year 850...
Our counterattack
has only just begun!
Our target is the Colossal Titan before us!
This is our chance!
Don't let it get away!
Hey, there...
It's been five years.
First Battle  Battle of Trost (1)
He was after the fixed cannons!
It's no coincidence it  went for the gate, either...
This thing really is...
sentient!
But this is our chance!
He's the only one that can take out the walls!
If I can kill him...
Too slow!
You're mine!
What?!
Go!
I missed?
No...
The Colossal Titan vanished?
Eren!
Did you defeat it?
No!
It was the same as five years ago...
He appeared out of nowhere,  and vanished just as suddenly!
I'm sorry.
I let him get away.
Why are you apologizing?
The rest of us couldn't even move—
Hey, there's no time for discussion!
The wall's been breached.
If we don't patch it fast,  the Titans will get in like before!
What are you doing?
The contingency plan for  the Colossal Titan has already begun.
Get to HQ!
Anyone who made contact with it,  don't forget to report!
Yes, sir!
Best of luck to the advance team!
Keep all personal belongings to a minimum!
Remain calm during the evacuation!
If they make it through,
we'll relive the tragedy that  befell us five years ago!
We stop the Titans here!
Prepare to intercept.
Fire!
Attack!
You trainees have all passed
the final training exercise,  and now are full-fledged soldiers.
We expect great things from you.
It's okay, Hannah...
I'll protect you.
Franz...
Are you okay, Armin?
I-I'm fine.
I'll get over it soon enough.
B-But we're in bad shape.
We currently don't have the means  to quickly patch an eight-meter hole...
We never even managed to dig up  that big rock near the front gate!
Since we can't seal the hole,  we'll have to abandon the town.
It's only a matter of time  before they breach Wall Rose!
Besides,
they can wipe out humanity  whenever they want, anyway!
Armin!
Calm down...
Things are different now.
Humanity won't be defeated by Titans anymore!
I'm sorry.
I'm all right...
Hey, are you paying attention?
Look...
I win again.
I'm nice enough to play with you every month,
but you never improve, Pixis.
I'm still no match for you, Marquis Bart.
Aren't you the high commander  overseeing the southern region?
How can you defeat the Titans  with that level of intelligence and skill?
Commander Pixis!
Urgent message!
How dare you interrupt our game—
The Colossal Titan has appeared in Trost.
It's destroyed the gate!
This drink is excellent...
It will be my honor  to take it with me into battle.
H-Hey...
Wait, Pixis!
Pixis! Wait, will you?!
I won't allow you to leave.
You must gather your forces,  and defend my territory!
That's your duty, isn't it?
Marquis Bart,
my men are risking their  lives in Trost right now.
Commander, I'll ready your horse.
And it's likely that  many have already lost their lives.
Many more dying this very moment,  as we indulge in idle chitchat.
They are expendable... Let them die.
And you've never even won at chess.
Your presence at the battle  will accomplish nothing.
Do not worry yourself, Marquis.
In a real battle against the Titans,
it is unnecessary for the commander  to throw the match.
That's enough.
Marquis Bart,
please enjoy a peaceful day,  as you would any other.
Wait...
Pixis! Come back, Pixis!
Pixis!
Information We Can Share So Far:
Fixed Cannons (1) Anti-Titan weapons in existence before the  invention of 3D maneuver gear. Placed on  the walls and modified for defensive purposes  to address the dearth in mobile troops.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Fixed Cannons (2) Grapeshot: Low lethality; used to slow Titans.  HE Projectile: Powerful, but extremely  inaccurate; targeted strikes are rarely successful.
Just follow your training! Split into groups!
Under the Garrison's orders,
you will resupply combatants, relay orders,
and kill Titans!
Garrison intercept forces will form the vanguard!
{\an7}Vanguard
Trainees, led by the supply team,  will comprise the middle guard!
{\an4\fad(300,0)}Middle Guard
The Garrison's elite forces will form the rearguard.
{\fad(340,0)}Rearguard
Also, messengers report that the  advance team has been neutralized.
The outer gate has been compromised,
and Titans have entered the city.
In other words, the Armored Titan
may appear at any time, to destroy the inner gate!
No way.
You're kidding...
If we lose Rose, too...
Silence!
As we speak, the vanguard is engaging them.
We have but one objective in this fight:
to defend Wall Rose with our lives  until the evacuation is complete!
Also, as you are all surely aware,
desertion in the face of the  enemy is punishable by death.
Mark this well,  and fight to your last dying breath!
Dismissed!
Yes, sir!
Why today?
As of tomorrow, I would've been in the Interior...
Are you okay?
No... No, no...
No, no... No!
You're in the way.
Hey, Jean... What's wrong?
"What's wrong?"
Unlike you, I don't have a death wish!
Since you wanted to join the Survey Corps,
I'm sure you're ready  to become Titan food anytime!
But I was to go to the Interior tomorrow!
Calm down!
I'm supposed to stay calm and die?
No!
Don't forget
those three years of hell we endured!
In the past three years,  we almost died so many times...
Some of us really did die.
Some ran, and some were kicked out...
But we made it!
Didn't we?
So we can make it through today!
You'll survive today, and go to  the Interior tomorrow, right?
Damn it.
Let's go, Daz!
Stop sobbing!
Yeah...
Eren...
When the fighting gets fierce, come find me.
Huh?
You and I are on different teams!
Plans will fall apart in the chaos of battle.
But I will protect you.
What are you saying—
Trainee Ackerman...
You're being specially moved to rearguard.
Follow me.
B-But I'll only slow them down!
I'm not asking your opinion.
The evacuation's falling behind.
We need as many skilled soldiers  overseeing civilians as possible.
B-But...
Hey!
Enough, Mikasa...
Don't you freak out, too!
Humanity is in danger of being wiped out.
What you want doesn't matter!
I'm sorry.
I wasn't thinking clearly.
But I do have one request.
Please... Don't die.
I'm not going to die.
I can't die here.
I still have no idea  what the world is really like.
Surviving historical documents
say nothing about the Titans' origins.
We know very little about them.
What information we do have comes from
reports made by the Survey Corps.
There has been no evidence that  their intelligence approaches our own.
Consequently, attempts to communicate  with them have been unsuccessful.
The Titan body structure
differs fundamentally from that of other creatures.
They lack sexual organs, and their  means of reproduction remains unknown.
However, most appear male.
They have extremely high body temperatures.
And inexplicably, they show no interest  in any creatures besides humans.
Their sole purpose in life seems to  be the consumption of humans.
But considering they have survived for more
than a century in an environment devoid of human life,
we can assume they have no need to eat at all.
In other words,
we believe their goal in feeding isn't  to gain sustenance, but simply to kill.
As to why they have posed  such a threat to humanity,
their incredible vitality is the main factor.
Humanity has possessed  cannon technology since antiquity,
but it has proved insufficient.
Even decapitated Titans will not die.
And while this isn't universally true,
they are capable of regenerating  their heads within one to two minutes.
No way...
Just their size is enough of a problem.
Sir, does this mean  the Titans are invincible?
They are not.
There is one way to defeat them.
Target this area.
Severe damage here will prevent regeneration,
and the Titan will die.
Thus, we use two swords to rend away their flesh.
If you can strike that vital spot,
you'll kill them before they  have time to regenerate.
Hey, Armin...
Isn't this a great chance?
If we're successful here,
before even joining the Survey Corps,
we'll definitely rise quickly through the ranks!
Yeah, you're right.
Just to be clear,
a lot of people want to join the  Survey Corps this time around.
You got the best of me earlier, but not anymore.
You think so, Thomas?
Then let's see who can kill more Titans.
Don't pad your numbers...
Team 34, advance!
Support the vanguard!
Okay, let's go!
Look at all those Titans!
The vanguard's been routed!
What are they doing?
After all their boasting?
I never thought this would be easy,
but this is...
An Aberrant!
Stop!
Huh?
How dare you?!
Eren!
Stop! Don't go alone!
Wait!
I'll avenge Thomas...
I won't let you get away!
Eren!
Eren!
No!
Please don't!
Why am I...
watching my friends be devoured?
Why
can't I
move?
A...
Armin...
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
What's wrong, Armin?
My grandpa was hiding this...
A book about the outside world!
About the outside world?
You aren't supposed to have that!
The Military Police will arrest you.
Forget all that...
It says that the majority  of the world is covered
by a huge body of water called the "sea."
And it's all saltwater!
Salt?
No way! Salt's worth a fortune!
The merchants would take it all.
It's too big to take it all!
There's no way...
And there's more...
Flaming water! Frozen earth!
Plains of sand, white as snow!
I'm sure the outside world
is many times bigger than  the world inside the walls!
The outside world...
Also...
This is still a secret, okay?
But my mom and dad say  they're going beyond the walls soon.
The outside world!
Hey, Eren...
Wouldn't it be great if, one day,  we could go explore the outside world, too?
Eren!
I can't die here...
Hey, Armin...
You told me about the outside world.
So...
I'm going out there...
Eren! Hurry!
A sudden rainfall.
The quiet sound of rain.
The humid air.
The scent of rain, ever so slightly sweet,
makes Mikasa remember  a gruesome event from her past.
The World the Girl Saw  The Battle for Trost (2)
What Should Be Done  Night Before the Counteroffensive (3)
When did you last change shafts?
Six days ago.
After the clean-up operation.
Just as the records say.
Okay, next.
You...
Krista Lenz, squad 42.
Check for wear.
Guess you can be punished for killing Titans...
It's weird, but those were valuable test subjects.
Sure, but why look for the  culprit among us trainees?
Yeah. We just finished the  battlefield clean-up today.
Everyone's exhausted.
They must've really hated Titans.
Yeah.
But in reality, they've  ended up helping the Titans...
Their desire for vengeance  may have been fulfilled,
but it's a blow to humanity.
I think I kind of get why they did it  because I'm also an idiot...
Before I saw the Titans,
I seriously planned to join the Survey Corps.
But I never want to see another.
And today, we have to decide which force to join.
Even Jean's seriously...
Everyone's regretting it.
If I'd known it'd be this hellish,
I'd have never chosen to be a soldier.
Now that I'm exhausted,
it's all I can think about...
Hey, Marco...
I can't even tell which are your bones anymore.
If I hadn't become a soldier,
I wouldn't have to think about  who'll be on that pile next.
Will we abandon the tactics that cost  tens of thousands of lives to develop,
and let the Titans eat us without a fight?
I know we have to fight...
But not everyone is as eager to die as you.
I hope you won't get mad when I say this...
But you aren't a strong person.
So you can relate to how the weak feel.
In addition, you excel in  sizing up any situation.
Isn't that why you immediately  know what should be done?
What should be done...
Hey, guys...
Have you decided which one you're joining?
I have.
I...
I...
I'm joining the Survey Corps!
Damn it.
Hey, Annie, what did you think?
Even Jean said he's joining the Survey Corps.
Huh? Jean said that?
Nothing in particular.
You're joining the Military Police right?
Maybe I should, too.
If someone told you to die, would you do it?
What? Of course not.
Then why not make your own decision?
Armin, what about you?
I...
I think if you know why you have to die,
there are times when you simply must.
Not that I want to.
I see... You've made your choice.
Yeah.
I've been thinking about  doing it for a long time.
Seriously? Armin, you, as well?
You're weak, but you have guts.
Th-Thank you.
Annie, you're actually pretty nice, aren't you?
It seems like you don't want  us to join the Survey Corps.
Isn't there a reason you want  to join the Military Police?
Not really.
It's only
that I want to survive.
It looks like they didn't find  any soldiers who've used
their Maneuver Gear without permission.
Then who did it?
No idea...
Right now, I'm more worried about  the upcoming induction ceremony.
How many among the new troops  will be crazy enough to join us?
Hey, Eren...
Are there any in your class  who will request to join us?
There are.
No, there were.
I don't know about now.
Attention!
Get ready.
We're going out on patrol.
Yes, sir!
Good morning, Captain Levi!
Listen, Eren...
Never fall two horse lengths behind me.
Don't forget that the only reason
you're not locked up is because I'm watching you.
Yes, sir!
Let's go.
Jean...
You're really joining the Survey Corps?
Yeah.
Why, all of a sudden?
I mean... Aren't you scared?
Huh?
Of course I don't want to join the Survey Corps.
Th-Then why...
It isn't that I decided the Titans don't scare me.
And I won't say something like,  "The best should join the Survey Corps."
I'm not as eager to die as some.
You mean Eren?
He already joined the Survey Corps.
Trainees, line up!
Line up before the stage!
{\an8}Line up before the stage!
I'm not risking my life because  someone convinced me.
This is a job you can't do unless  you decide for yourself.
I am Erwin Smith, Commander of the Survey Corps.
Today, you will choose a military branch.
Put bluntly, I'm here to persuade  you to join the Survey Corps.
During the Titan attack,
you learned how terrifying they can be.
And how limited your own power is.
However...
This battle brought humanity
closer to victory than it's ever been.
Through Eren Jaeger's existence.
By risking his own life, he's proven himself,
without doubt, a friend to humanity.
With his help, not only did we  stop the Titans' advance,
but we have a way to discover their true nature.
We believe that in the basement  of his Zhiganshina home,
there are answers about the Titans  that he himself doesn't have.
If we can reach that basement,
we will find a clue that will end  this century of Titan rule.
The basement?
We've already advanced that far?
If we learn what they are, we can end this!
No matter how much he wants recruits,
I can't believe he's publicizing this information.
Or does he have some hidden motive?
What is he trying to see?
Branch Selection (1)  After three years of training, a ceremony  is held in which trainees choose among the  Garrison, Survey Corps, or Military Police.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Branch Selection (2)  However, only the top ten can enter the  Military Police, so the choice is limited to the  Survey Corps or the Garrison. Most select the Garrison.
We will head for the basement in Zhiganshina.
However, that requires us to retake Wall Maria.
In other words, our objective hasn't changed.
But with the Trost gate sealed,
we'll have to take the long way  around, from Karanes to the east.
The four years we spent laying a route
for a large army have gone to waste.
In those four years,
more than sixty percent  of the Survey Corps lost their lives.
Sixty percent in four years...
An insane figure.
Any trainees who join
will participate in our excursion  beyond the walls, in a month.
We expect thirty percent won't return.
In four years, most will be dead.
But those who survive
will become superior soldiers  with a high survival rate.
Knowing these discouraging facts,
any still willing to risk their lives, remain here.
Ask yourself...
Are you willing to offer your  beating heart for humanity?
That is all.
Anyone who wishes to join another  branch is dismissed.
Commander...
Don't you think you scared them a little much?
All of them will leave!
Damn it...
Come on, you already decided!
Don't make me hate myself any more...
If I don't leave now, I'll have  to face them again.
I left the village to join the Military Police...
My mom will be happy.
If I join the Military Police, the whole  village will think better of me.
We all already know...
We've seen it...
How the Titans...
...eat humans!
Can you die if you're ordered to?
I don't want to die!
I see.
I like the looks on your faces.
Then I welcome everyone  here to the Survey Corps!
This is a true salute!
Offer up your hearts!
Everyone...
This is terrible.
The Survey Corps...
I'm scared!
I want to go home...
I don't even care.
If you were going to cry, you should have left.
You have done well to endure your fear.
You are brave soldiers.
You have my heartfelt respect.
Salute!
I'm Squad Leader Ness.
And this is Shallot, my horse.
She loves to chew off your hair,
so be careful if you don't want to be bald.
Nice to meet you all!
Hey! S-Stop it, Shallot!
Hey, someone grab her!
Our training began the next day.
Instead of practical training,  it was mostly memorizing the
long-range scouting formation  Commander Erwin had devised.
Strangely,
while it was written in exacting detail,
Eren Jaeger's position was nowhere to be found.
You new recruits will be here.
You'll be between the cart guard team
and the recon support team.
Your job will be to ride alongside the  spare horses and relay messages.
The Special Operations Squad will be here.
Standing by in the center of the last ranks.
We're pretty far back.
It's the safest place in the formation.
We're even better protected  than the supply carts.
Well, this time, our goal is  just to go out and return.
This expedition is so short
because it's a practice run for  your journey to Zhiganshina.
Um...
I still don't know what this  power should be used for...
Did you understand what the  Commander's question meant?
What do you think the enemy is?
Did you all understand?
No...
It may be a lie to claim  we understand everything.
But I think—
It's possible this mission has another goal.
But the Commander decided
it was best not to reveal that  fact to the soldiers.
So we should just focus on  getting there and back.
Believe in the Commander.
Right...
That's all the training for today.
Prepare to go back.
Th-That's...
Sir, may I go talk with my classmates?
Get going...
Hey, Mikasa! Armin!
Eren...
Feels like it's been a long time!
Eren, did they do anything bad to you?
Like investigating every square inch of you?
Or psychological torture?
No way.
That short guy went too far.
Someday, I'll see him pay for it.
You don't mean Captain Levi, do you?
Hey, Eren...
It's been so long!
What? Everyone's here?
But if you're here, then...
That doesn't mean you joined  the Survey Corps, does it?
Is there any other reason we'd be here?
So only Jean, Annie, and Marco  joined the Military Police?
No way... Not you, too!
Marco's dead.
What was that?
Did you say Marco's dead?
Seems not everyone gets a dramatic death.
I don't even know how he died.
He died without anyone knowing, or anyone seeing.
Marco...
Hey, new kids, get over here!
Your uniforms are here!
Are you really...
Yes, we'll also be participating in the mission.
Hey, Eren.
I heard that when you turned into  a Titan, you tried to kill Mikasa.
What does that mean?
No. Eren was trying to hit a fly...
I wasn't asking you.
Mikasa, it looks like the wound  on your cheek is pretty bad.
When did you get that?
I've heard it's true.
When I became a Titan,  I tried to kill Mikasa.
If you heard, then you don't remember it, right?
In other words, you had no idea  you even had this Titan power,
and you don't have the means to control it.
Yes, that's right.
Did you hear that?
This is the situation.
Humanity and our lives depend on him.
We'll probably die just like Marco,
without Eren ever realizing it.
Jean, what's the point in asking  Eren these questions now?
Listen, Mikasa.
Not everyone's like you,
willing to die for Eren's sake  with nothing in return...
We should know what we're dying for.
Otherwise, we will hesitate  when the time comes.
We want something in return from him.
So let me see what he has to offer.
And whether it's worth my life.
So, Eren...
I'm really counting on you.
Right.
Sir, it's almost time.
We've driven away all the Titans in the area.
Thirty seconds until we open the gate!
It's the Survey Corps!
They call the emblem on their  back the Wings of Freedom!
So cool...
It's time!
Humanity will take another step forward.
Show me what you can do!
Open the gate!
Advance!
We will now begin the 57th  expedition beyond the walls!
Onward!
Entering long-range scouting formation,
the Survey Corps advances beyond the walls.
However, they suddenly encounter
a mysterious Titan that possesses intelligence.
Female Titan  57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (1)
A Dim Light in the Darkness of Despair  Humanity Rises Again (1)
You there!
Yes, sir!
Who are you?
Armin Arlert, from Zhiganshina!
Yeah? That's a stupid name.
Your parents give you that?
My grandfather!
Arlert, what are you doing here?
Trying to aid humanity's victory!
That is indeed wonderful...
Then you will feed the Titans.
Row 3, about face!
Who are you?
Thomas Wagner, from Trost!
I can't hear you!
Thomas Wagner, from—
{\an8}Too soft! Go practice in the cattle shed!
There he goes...
When you were a trainee,
{\an8}You, next!
your first day was just the same.
{\an8}Mina Karolina, from Karanes!
It brings back memories.
Wrong!
You are from the pig shed, worth less than cattle.
Yes, sir! I am less than cattle!
{\an8}No, you're a fly, swarming around a pig's ass!
What's the point of screaming at them?
It's a rite of passage.
{\an8}Yes, sir!
We force them to abandon who they are,
{\an8}Next!
{\an8}Samuel Linke-Jackson, from Snate Village!
then raise them from nothing as pure soldiers.
{\an8}A horrible name! Change it now!
{\an8}What are you doing here?
It is a necessary process.
Sacrificing myself for humanity!
Row 4, about face!
It seems not all of them are  being subjected to that process.
{\an8}Listen up! I've seen a lot of shit in my time,
There is no need for those who have  already undergone the rite of passage.
{\an8}but you are the sorriest pieces  of shit I've ever seen.
If I were to guess,
{\an8}You're in for three years of hell!
they probably lived through hell two years ago.
You can see it in their eyes.
Now, let's go.
Who are you?!
Jean Kirschstein, from Trost!
What are you doing here?
Joining the Military Police,  for a life deep within the walls.
Oh, I see...
You want access to the Interior?
Yes.
Who said you could sit down?!
Anyone who can't handle this
will never make the Military Police!
Who are you?  What are you doing here?
Marco Bott, Jinae City, Wall Rose South District!
I want to join the Military Police,
to offer the King my body and self in service!
Really...
I'm glad to hear that.
Good luck.
However...
The King doesn't want your body.
Next! You!
Who are you?
Connie Springer, of Ragako Village,  Wall Rose South District!
You're doing it wrong, Connie Springer...
I explained that this salute demonstrates
your resolve to devote your  entire heart to the people.
Is your heart on your right side?
Hey, you...
What are you doing?
You're the one I'm talking to! You!
Who are you?!
Sasha Blause, from Dauper village,  Wall Rose South District!
Sasha Blause,
what are you holding in your right hand?
A boiled potato!
The kitchen had a fresh batch, and I couldn't resist.
Did you steal it?
Why?
Why would you choose to eat a potato now?
Letting it get cold would've been a waste,
so I decided I should eat it now.
Well, I still don't understand...
Why would you eat that potato?
Are you asking me why people eat potatoes?
You can have half...
Half...
He's still making that potato girl run.
Wow, five straight hours?
But she seemed more distraught  when told she wouldn't get dinner
than when told she must run until she dropped.
If I remember correctly,
Dauper Village is a tiny hunting  village, deep in the mountains.
What's that?
The dropouts.
They requested a transfer, to the frontier.
What? But it's only the first day.
It was only a matter of time.
If you aren't strong enough,  you have to leave.
Hard to believe they'd rather go back  to weeding and picking up rocks.
Hey, he didn't ask where  you were from, did he?
Zhiganshina, the same as him.
I see... That's...
Then, weren't you there that day?
H-Hey...
Did you see the Colossal Titan?
Y-Yeah...
I already told you I saw it.
Really?
How big was it?
Big enough to look over the walls.
What? I heard it stepped right over them.
Me, too!
That's what they said in my village.
No, it wasn't that tall.
What did it look like?
It barely had any skin,  but it had a huge mouth.
What about the Armored Titan  that broke Wall Maria?
They call it that,
but it looked like a normal Titan to me.
Th-Then what's a normal Titan like?
Guys, let's stop with the questions.
I'm sure he'd prefer to forget some things.
I'm sorry for asking—
Don't be!
The Titans aren't all that tough...
If we can master  the Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear,
they won't stand a chance!
Finally, I'm able to train as a soldier...
I was just so excited, I forgot myself for a second.
I'm joining the Survey Corps, so I can  wipe the Titans off the face of this earth.
I'll kill them all—
Hey, are you nuts?
Did you just say you want  to join the Survey Corps?
Yeah, I did.
And you said you wanted to join the  Military Police to take it easy, right?
I'm no liar...
I'm a straight talker, unlike someone  who pretends to have balls of steel,
even when he's about to piss himself.
Are you talking about me?
D-Don't...
Hey, I didn't...
Well, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to say you're  doing the wrong thing.
Peace?
Yeah.
I'm sorry, too.
Hey, you...
W-W-Well, uh...
It's just that you look  different than the rest of us.
I'm s-sorry...
Your hair is very pretty.
Thank you.
I'm fine, leave me alone.
You're always so impulsive when you're riled up.
This again?
Anyway, isn't your hair a little long?
It could cause an accident when you're  practicing with the Maneuver Gear.
Very well.
I'll cut it.
But how short should it be?
H-Hey!
That's my shirt!
What did you wipe on my shirt?
My trust.
Finally done...
This is...
Bread!
That's all I could get, but I saved it for you...
But you should drink some water first.
Are you god?!
God!
Hey, what are you two doing?
Um, she spent the whole day running...
So you're trying to do a good deed?
Did you do that for the potato girl?
Was the effort worth what you got out of it?
Well, it doesn't matter...
Anyway, I'm carrying her to bed.
Are you doing a good deed, too?
I'm doing her a favor so she'll owe me.
I'm looking forward to  a lot of fun from this idiot.
First, we'll evaluate what you have!
Anyone unable to do this can't  even serve as a decoy!
They will be sent to the frontier.
These involve only the rudimentary basics,
but even at this stage, you can see their  potential with the Maneuver Gear.
Look.
She's steady as a rock.
She knows exactly what to do.
That's what I mean by potential.
Looks like we have a lot of talent this year.
Um, what about him?
That's exactly my point.
You may have the will,
but not necessarily the talent.
What are you doing, Eren Jaeger?!
Pick yourself up!
What is this?
How am I supposed to do this?
This can't be happening...
Information We Can Share So Far:   Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear Training (1)  Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear Training is  a difficult process, meant to force the trainee to   adapt from moving in a flat 2D plane to a 3D space.
Information We Can Share So Far:   Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear Training (2)  High endurance, strong legs,  good spatial awareness,  and nerves of steel are requisites.
Stick to the basics, and you should be fine.
Don't worry about doing well.
Watch the balance and stay centered.
Slowly rest your weight on the belts  attached to your hips and feet.
Stay calm, and you can do it.
I was able to.
Okay, I think I can do it this time!
Raise me, Armin!
Hey, Daz...
Isn't that the kid
from yesterday who said  he'd kill all the Titans?
Well, I bet he'll be off to the frontier tomorrow.
We don't have enough food  to feed worthless rejects.
Eren...
There's no point in worrying.
You just have to figure it out tomorrow.
I'm pathetic...
I'll never be able to kill them all like this.
You should let that idea go.
What?!
You should give up on being a soldier.
There are other ways to fight than  by throwing away your life.
Listen here...
I saw what happened that day!
You really think you'll convince me this way?
But it doesn't matter how much you want it.
Why not?
It isn't your decision whether you  end up a soldier or not, Eren.
I'm not saying you should return  to the frontier alone.
{\an8}Let's go, Armin.
{\an8}S-Sure.
Don't worry...
I will go with you.
Um, anyway...
So, can I take that?
The trick to staying upright?
Sorry, but I'm a genius.
All I can say is to feel it.
Actually, I'd like you to tell me...
How are you still sane, after you  humiliated yourself like that?
Guys, I'm begging you here...
But didn't you say just yesterday
something like, "People who aren't  strong enough should leave"?
Am I wrong?
Or was it, "If you don't have the  talent, you have to leave"?
Which was it?
Please!
I've heard you two are really good!
Bertolt... Reiner!
Sorry, but I can't imagine any  trick to just hanging there.
I don't think I can give you the  advice you're looking for.
Okay...
We'll just have to hope for the best tomorrow.
You two are from Zhiganshina, aren't you?
Yes... Why?
Then you should know how  terrifying the Titans are.
Why did you decide to be soldiers?
I'm not like Eren.
I didn't see them at close range.
But when I thought about how the government
forced people into that insane plan  to retake Titan territory,
I had to do something.
I see.
Where are you two from?
Reiner and I come from a small village  in the mountains of southeast Wall Maria.
But... That means...
Yeah.
It isn't like the big towns by the rivers...
The news was slow to reach us.
In fact, the Titans reached us first.
It was dawn...
The animals were unusually restless,
and we heard a rumbling  we'd never heard before.
Eventually, as it got louder,  we realized it was the sound of footsteps.
And when I rushed to open the window...
Beyond that,
I don't really remember.
Everyone was in a panic.
Hey...
Why are you discussing this now?
I'm sorry...
What I meant to say is this:
you aren't like the others.
The others?
Those here who don't understand how  terrifying the Titans really are.
Enough.
The vast majority are here  because they don't want to lose face.
Told they'd be admitting they were  cowards if they chose to be workers
after turning twelve,  they became trainees.
But we're not really so different.
We chose this hoping to join the Military Police  because they're safe, deep in the Interior.
If that doesn't work, we may just give it all up.
I don't have any will of my own...
There's nothing wrong with valuing your own life.
I just want
to return to the homeland I lost.
That's all I have left to go on.
I'm going back, no matter what.
You...
Why did you become a soldier?
I...
I decided I had to kill them.
I had to kill all the Titans myself...
That was what I decided.
So even after seeing the Titans,  you didn't surrender to despair?
No.
Though I don't know if  I can even become a soldier now.
Review and recheck everything,  starting with your belt.
Tomorrow will go fine.
You can do it.
Eren Jaeger, was it?
Yes, thank you.
Reiner Braun, right?
Eren Jaeger, are you ready?
Yes!
I'll do this...
I can do this!
I may not have talent,
but I have more guts than anyone.
Begin!
I don't know the theory...
I don't have any evidence.
But this is all I've got!
This is my weapon!
I did it.
I did it!
N-Not yet...
I'm not giving up yet!
Put him down.
I... I...
Wagner, change belts with Jaeger.
Y-Yes, sir.
Your equipment was defective.
The fitting on your belt was damaged.
I've never heard of this part getting damaged.
I'll have to add it to the maintenance checklist.
So, he managed to stay upright for  a bit, even with a broken belt?
Wow...
Th-Then, did I pass?
You're fine.
Commence training.
I did it! I really did it!
Did you see that, Mikasa?
I can do this!
I can fight the Titans!
I don't need you taking care of me anymore!
I guess it all worked out.
He's looking at us, as if to say, "See!"
No...
He's relieved because he thinks we  won't have to be separated now.
Grisha...
Today, your son
became a soldier.
Eren graduates from the Trainee Corps,
and he sees humanity regain its dignity.
"We can defeat the Titans."
Just as he becomes sure of this,
humanity learns a lesson once again.
Night of the Graduation Ceremony  Humanity Rises Again (2)
We will now begin the 57th  expedition beyond the walls!
Onward!
We believe that in the basement of  Eren Jaeger's Zhiganshina home,
there are answers about the Titans  that he himself doesn't have.
We will head there.
You new recruits will be here.
You'll be between the cart guard team
and the recon support team.
Your job will be to ride alongside the  spare horses and relay messages.
The Special Operations  Squad will be here.
Standing by in the center  of the last ranks.
It's the safest place in the formation.
{\fad(180,0)}Row 5-Center: Standby
We're even better protected  than the supply carts.
That's no Aberrant.
It's intelligent!
Like the Armored or Colossal  Titans, or Eren...
A human in the body of a Titan!
Its movements are much more  precise than the others' are!
Damn it.
I...
I underestimated it!
It protected its neck...
Damn it! I can't get away!
Jean!
Avenge the suicidal bastard!
It stopped?
That's the one...
That's the one that killed him!
He rushed to his death  on the right flank!
Avenge him!
We've bought enough time, right?
Let's get the hell away from it!
No... Why?
Is it
heading toward Eren?
Forest of Giant Trees  57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (2)
How's your 3D Maneuver Gear looking, Armin?
It's okay...
The clasp released as intended,  so it seems it's not broken.
I see...
I'm glad to hear it.
But what do we do?
We only have one horse.
If Jean's horse comes back,  the three of us can move, but...
Damn it, why?
Reiner's horse returned, so why didn't mine?
We can't stay here any longer.
In the worst case, we'll have  to leave someone here...
But how would we decide who to leave?
Armin, since he's wounded?
Reiner, since he's big and would have  trouble riding with someone else?
Or should I run and try to find my horse?
Damn it!
Why the hell do I have to think about this?!
We all made it through that fight alive.
This isn't fair...
Armin...
Hey, Armin!
Are you still out of it?
Yeah, my head's still a bit fuzzy...
I see...
But we must decide.
It's a hard choice, but someone  will have to stay behind.
Wait!
First, let's fire a smoke round...
If the formation continued straight ahead,
the row 4-3 team should be nearby.
That's the signal for an emergency...
But I can't imagine they'll understand  our intentions just from that.
Armin, we can wait another three minutes.
By then, we must decide—
I'll stay.
But there's something I want  you to tell them for me...
Preferably to Commander Erwin alone—
No, Armin.
You should tell him yourself.
Looks like someone's here...
And with two horses!
That's...
Krista!
Is everyone okay?
That's my horse...
Whoa, whoa.
Calm down, Buchwald.
He ran toward me, terrified...
Did you engage the Titans?
Armin, what happened to you?
Are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
I can't believe that smoke  round brought you here.
I was nearby, and I already had Jean's horse.
Even horses like you.
It seems you have a strange charisma.
You saved our lives.
But I'm so glad
that the worst didn't happen to you.
I really am glad.
God...
A goddess.
I want to marry her.
Well, we should rejoin the  formation as soon as possible.
Yeah, there should be orders to retreat.
To think we've been pushed back,  less than an hour out of the walls.
Things are even bleaker  than I'd imagined...
And for some reason,
it went in the opposite direction from  the vanguard command team...
It?
A green round?
Looks like they're continuing the operation,
only changing course...
What?
That wasn't a retreat command?
What is Commander Erwin thinking?
In theory, any soldier has  the authority to determine
when mission completion  is no longer possible.
Did command not see our  smoke round somehow?
Even if we don't know what's going on,
there's still only one thing for us to do...
Follow the order!
Smoke round.
Green.
Oluo, you fire it.
Roger.
For now, everything seems to be going fine.
But is it really?
We may already have casualties  on the front lines.
Reporting!
Message to pass along!
Right flank recon has been destroyed!
Our recon system is partially inoperative.
Pass this on, to the left.
Did you hear that, Petra?
Go.
Yes, Captain.
The right flank?!
I think that's where Armin is.
But Armin and the others should still  be in position, near the center.
The Titans can't have made it in that far...
A black round?
Aberrants?
Eren, you fire it.
R-Right!
What a mess.
We let it penetrate deep into our formation.
It's almost here...
The Titan.
Beneath those smoke rounds,  is there someone fighting?
Damn it...
Look over here.
You monster...
Now!
Three separate attacks at once...
You're pretty smart, but you can't  possibly protect all three targets!
Spine, Achilles tendon...
It doesn't matter!
Hit one, and we will slow it down...
Go!
Damn you for causing so many deaths!
We'll make you die a slow, painful death!
It jumped?
L-Let me go!
The most important thing is  to ensure they hear of this...
I must tell them what we're up against!
An Aberrant?!
It got in all the way here?
We'll take it out!
We can't let it penetrate any farther!
The right flank's been wiped out?
But we aren't withdrawing?
{\fad(1450,0)}Row 3-1: Cargo
Why?!
No idea...
The Commander's orders...
Just relay the message to the left!
What's going on?
Row 1-13: Recon
We keep heading east.
Our goal is supposed to  be south, to the old city.
Row 1-5: Recon
Right now, our formation's on a collision course.
Yeah.
You can see it...
The forest of giant trees!
Information We Can Share So Far:
Forest of Giant Trees (1)  Isolated forests of giant trees can be  found within and beyond the walls.  They occur naturally in certain areas,  and tree heights can exceed 80 meters.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Forest of Giant Trees (2)  Before Wall Maria's fall, this particular forest was a tourist area.  Now, it is a strategically important location used by the Survey  Corps to protect themselves from Titans during expeditions.
Seems Titans passed through here.
There's nothing growing on the road.
We can bring the carts through, too.
Send word to the rear
that only the central cart guard  should enter the forest.
Yes, sir!
Excuse me, sir...
The center row appears to  be entering the forest,
but wouldn't the rest of  us collide with the forest?
We're going around.
Yes, sir!
Hey, what are we doing at this tourist spot?
We're totally off from both our original  destination and our return point.
I don't know...
I don't know, but the order came from  Commander Erwin, after all.
He must have a plan.
What kind of plan?
Are they planning to hold a welcome ceremony
for us new recruits at a tourist spot?
No, I don't think so.
That was a joke.
Anyway, that giant woman's following us.
No matter what his plan, we can't stay here.
The only thing I can imagine
is that we're passing through  on our way to somewhere else...
Everyone, halt!
All right. Listen up, recruits.
We will now make preparations  to launch a counterattack.
Draw your blades, and wait above in the trees.
If any Titans try to enter this forest,  stop them at all costs!
U-Um, sir, what do you—
Shut up and follow orders!
Seriously?
What's going on?
H-Hey, it looks like only the center  line went into the woods.
What happened to the formation?
It's gone.
The forest blocks our advance,  so the left and right flanks
will have to skirt the forest.
We've lost our recon ability.
Why didn't we change course  to avoid this forest?
Did Commander Erwin read the map wrong?
I don't know...
Perhaps we tried too hard to avoid the threat
on the right flank and ended up here...
This is insane...
We've abandoned the original  mission to cache supplies.
And when we abandoned it,  we should've turned tail and run...
But instead, we're forging  ahead to a tourist trap.
And now, we're just standing here,
to stop any Titans that enter the woods?
Damn him for giving a crazy order.
He'll hear you...
And this no real explanation  thing is innovative, too.
Of course, I'm sure he has his own concerns...
What do you mean?
A commander deemed worthless  by his men in a critical situation
quite often succumbs to a  mysterious attack from behind.
I'm just saying it wouldn't surprise me.
Jean, so what are you going to do?
Don't be so serious...
This situation's got me a  bit worked up, that's all.
What am I going to do?
Obey my orders, and keep  Titans out of the forest.
You also think it's the right move, don't you?
Ah—
You look like you know something.
Well...
Five-meter class incoming!
Why bring the formation here?
What is Commander Erwin thinking?
No, that isn't what  we should think about.
The Female Titan is pursuing Eren.
And the Commander knows that.
Assume those two things,  and see what you can deduce...
Captain...
Captain Levi!
What?
Well...
We're in the middle of the woods!
If the center enters alone,
we won't know if Titans are approaching!
It seems something's approaching us from the right...
How are we supposed to dodge  the Titans or protect the carts?
Don't go on and on about the obvious...
We can't do that anymore, of course.
Th-Then why?
Look around, Eren...
At all these big-ass trees.
It's the perfect environment  for 3D Maneuver Gear.
And try to use that tiny brain of yours...
If you don't want to die, think.
Yes, sir!
I see.
I just can't keep up right now  because I'm still new.
He won't just tell me the answer.
I have to figure it out for myself.
I'm sure that's how they all learned to fight.
What the hell?
Seriously?
Damn it all... What the hell is going on here?
Wait!
Wait a minute... No one knows  what's really going on?
Maybe not even Captain Levi?
The Female Titan is after Eren...
If I'm right about that,
then there's only one reason to come here.
This is where Commander Erwin intends  to deal with the Female Titan...
Armin...
Our orders were to keep the  Titans out of the forest, right?
In other words...
There's no longer any reason to fight...
Right?
A black smoke round?
It's from directly behind us!
It's whatever was coming  toward us on the right.
Draw your blades.
If we see it, it'll only be for a second.
Go!
It's fast!
In these trees, there's no way to  foresee and evade its attacks!
It'll catch us!
Captain, let's switch to Maneuver Gear!
Captain!
You won't escape!
Reinforcements from the rear!
Captain, your orders?!
Let's go for it!
It's dangerous...
We should kill it!
I'll rip you apart!
Fool, you've run straight into hell.
You're chasing a group of master Titan killers!
Captain Levi?
Captain!
Give us your orders.
At this rate, it {\i1}will{\i0} catch up with us!
We kill it here...
That's why we came to this forest!
Right, Captain?
Captain, your orders!
Everyone, cover your ears.
The Female Titan continues its pursuit,  leaving carnage in its wake.
Despite witnessing their  friends being slaughtered
before their very eyes,  the Survey Corps can only flee.
Eren is faced with a decision.
Bite   57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (3)
We will now begin the 57th  expedition beyond the walls!
Onward!
The Survey Corps left to  find a route to Zhiganshina,
but encountered a Female Titan,
a transformed human like Eren.
That's no Aberrant.
It's a human in the body of a Titan!
As soldiers died, one after the next,
they headed into a  forest of giant trees,
none of them knowing why.
If Squad Levi doesn't  defeat it, who will?
Choose.
Believe in yourself.
Or believe in the Survey Corps and me.
I'll go forward!
Fire!
Oh, right...
I wanted to ask you something.
Is it okay if we cut off  your hands and legs?
They'll grow back, right?
I'm talking about {\i1}your {\i0} limbs, not the Titan's.
We need you alive, after all...
The enemy was willing  to sacrifice everything.
I didn't expect the enemy to destroy  itself along with the evidence
by making Titans devour itself.
Retreat, men!
Back into formation!
Return to Karanes!
Erwin...
Why did you order Levi to resupply?
There's no time to waste.
The Female Titan was eaten.
But did you see the  person inside get eaten?
I didn't.
You can't mean...
Yes...
If your original hypothesis was correct,
and they can still move to a degree  after regaining human form...
And if they'd equipped  Maneuver Gear in advance...
The one within the Female Titan  is wearing our uniform right now.
Captain Levi?
No, it's not!
Who are you?!
Gunther!
The enemy is now camouflaged  as one of our men.
Crushing Blow  57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (5)
When the Colossal Titan vanished,
whoever was inside had been  wearing Maneuver Gear,
so that they could escape in the steam.
Don't you think the same  possibility applies here?
But at the time...
Based on what we saw when Eren  emerged from the Titan,
we concluded it would be impossible.
His equipment was destroyed,  and his uniform was gone.
Above all, Eren was so weak,  he couldn't even stand unassisted.
The Female Titan was able to  attract other Titans with its cry.
We failed to predict this,  and the operation failed.
If Titan abilities vary  depending on skill,
it was a mistake to use Eren, a total novice,  as the basis for our assumptions.
If we are to outwit our enemy,  we'll need to think outside the box.
If we're withdrawing, does that  mean the mission succeeded?
If so, then we may already know who  was inside the Female Titan.
I'd like to see who it is...
But why was the Commander so sure
that the enemy would come after  Eren if he left the walls?
I think it's because, for some reason,
they suddenly stopped their advance  in the midst of the last assault.
Even though they managed  to break through Trost's gate,
they didn't even try for the inner gate.
And when Eren sealed  the gate, they let him.
It could mean that they now  have bigger concerns...
Bigger concerns?
Something more important to  them than breaching the walls.
Something unexpected that happened.
Eren's transformation into a Titan?!
I think it's the only answer.
Then... That means...
Wait... So...
Someone who was there,  who saw Eren transform,
is the Titan.
Gunther!
Eren, don't stop!
Onward!
But Gunther...
Who's there?
Protect Eren!
Damn it, what do we do?
Eldo, where should we go?
There isn't time to reach the horses!
Head for HQ, as fast as you can!
Is it from the Female Titan?  Or is there more than one?
Damn you...
How dare you?!
Come at me!
I'll defeat you, even if it kills me!
The Female Titan?
Impossible... Why?
Didn't we catch it?!
If the enemy has some way  to retain its strength,
it may be able to transform once more.
I knew it...
It's coming!
The Female Titan!
Damn you...
How dare you!
This time, I will defeat it!
No!
The three of us will  kill the Female Titan.
You will continue to head  straight for HQ at top speed!
Here's what I have gleaned  from this battle...
If we only focus on  making the best moves,
we will never get the  better of our opponent.
When necessary, we must be  willing to take big risks,
and be prepared to lose everything.
I'll fight, too!
No!
This is the best move...
Your power is too risky!
What? Do you doubt us?
Do you, Eren?
Do you find it that hard to trust us?
Unless we change how we fight,
humanity cannot win!
I believe my squad will be victorious.
Good luck!
We took its sight.
For at least a minute,  it'll be in total darkness!
Kill it during this time!
Screw capturing it...
Kill it now!
Die here without honor!
Make that bitch of a Titan pay!
We won't let your eyes regenerate!
We'll shear off so much muscle  around your shoulders,
you won't be able to keep your arms up!
Shear it off...
Make its arms...
...fall!
They're down!
Now the neck!
Shear off the muscles  that support its neck!
And we can strike its weak point!
They're so strong.
The Female Titan is  totally on the defensive.
How can they launch co-op attacks like that without even speaking to each other?
I bet it's only possible because  they believe in one another.
They've overcome many  hardships that way.
That's why they're so strong,  even right after losing Gunther.
I'll go forward...
If I go forward and believe in them,  without turning back, then...
I'm sure that's the right answer.
I finally understand!
I don't know...
I never have.
I can believe in my own abilities
or the choices of companions I trust.
But no one ever knows  how it will turn out.
Strike the neck, now!
Eldo!
H-How?
It can't possibly see!
It hasn't even been thirty seconds...
Only one eye?
It prioritized one eye  to accelerate the healing...
Is that even possible?
Petra!
We need to regroup!
Petra, now!
Hey...
Die!
How?
My blade can't pierce it...
I...
I will...
I'll kill it!
Eren?
Wait, what? Mikasa?
That voice... Don't tell me...

I made the wrong choice...
I wanted to believe in my companions...
Because of that, everyone died!
If I had believed in myself  from the start and fought...
If I'd only killed it at the beginning!
Back then,
if I'd turned into a Titan...
No...
If I'd fought
even before that...
Captain Levi was there, too.
We would have won.
Maybe we could've captured it.
You aren't wrong.
{\fad(1,229)}If you want to, do it.
I...
I made a choice.
And it killed everyone.
It's my fault they died.
But despite all that...
It's still your fault!
I'll tear you apart...

I'll rip you apart...  Tear you to shreds...
Rip you into tiny pieces...
And eat you!
Eren!
W-Wait... Eren...
Don't go...

Give him back!
Why won't my blade penetrate?
I know that
he's alive...
I know that Eren's alive!
No matter where she goes, I'll kill her,
rip her apart,
and get you out of that filth.
I'm sorry, Eren...
Just wait a little longer...
Wait!
Wh-What are you...
Fall back for now.
Maintain this distance.
It may be tired.
It does not appear to  be going very fast.
He seems to have been bit  right out of the neck.
Is Eren dead?
"Eren is alive."
"Give Eren back."
The Female Titan took Eren from  Mikasa before her very eyes.
Mikasa joins forces with humanity's  strongest fighter, Levi,
to challenge the Female Titan to battle.
The Defeated   57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (6)
In the year 850...
The Colossal Titan reappeared  and breached the wall.
And once again, humanity could  not stop a Titan invasion.
Soldiers fell, one after the  next, before the Titan assault.
And then...
Eren! Hurry!
Eren fell victim to the Titans.
Mikasa's amazing, though...
How does she move so fast?
No, I knew she wasn't  her usual calm self.
I'll win, no matter what.
I'll live, no matter what!
When Mikasa faced certain death,
a mysterious Titan appeared  that attacked other Titans.

I won't leave you here.
B-But...
Carrying someone,
while leaping through  a Titan-filled area—
Let's go!
No...
Stop it.
If you don't, I'm going to...
I'm going to cause  another friend to die!
Wait!
Listen to me...
I have a plan!
A plan?
You two will have to execute it,
so you decide...
I know it's crazy,
but could we use that Titan?
That Titan?
It attacks other Titans...
It isn't interested in us.
Could we lead it to the  supply area somehow?
If it defeats the other Titans,  everyone might be saved!
Lead it?!
How would we do that?
I think it's fighting instinctively.
The two of you will defeat  the Titans near it.
That should make it move to find more.
It should head toward HQ.
We can't do something that  dangerous on a hunch!
But if it works, we might be able  to destroy all the Titans around HQ.
It's worth a try.
Huh?
Are you serious?
Better to try something than  to simply wait for death.
Let's go with Armin's plan.
Fight the Titans with another Titan?
Yes, that's right.
If we fail, they'll laugh at us...
But if we succeed,  everyone will survive.
Let's prepare ourselves.
Fine... Fine!
Do I have the right?
The right to be in a  position of responsibility?
No.
I have it wrong.
This is the time.
Now, with all those Titans  concentrated there.
This is our chance!
Now!
We run into HQ right now!
It's our only chance...
Once we're out of gas, it's over.
Full speed ahead!
Jean!
Thank you.
Thanks to you, we made it out safely.
Huh?
It's thanks to you.
I told you you're cut  out for leadership!
I don't know about that!
Damn it!
How many made it?
I took advantage of our comrades' deaths.
Many died at my command...
Aren't you guys with the supply team?
Yeah...
Stop it, Jean!
They are the ones who abandoned us!
Because of you, more died  than was necessary!
Titans came into the supply area...
We couldn't do anything!
Doing something is your job!
Get down!
Damn it!
Too many people are in one place!
Hurry, get inside!
We can't all fit!
Where's Mikasa?!
She must've ran out of gas,  and got eaten long ago!
This is normal.
This is reality...
Was my hope just an impossible dream?
I should've known....
that this is reality.
It should've been a simple  enough realization
that we could never  beat something so huge.
What?
Wh-What is that?
Mikasa?
That was close... I'm all out.
But we did it! We just barely made it!
Y-You're alive!
You did it, Armin!
Ow!
Your plan worked!
Everyone!
That Titan is an Aberrant  that kills other Titans!
And it isn't interested in us...
If we can use it, we can escape!
Use the Titan?
A Titan helping us?
That sounds like a dream—
It isn't a dream.
I don't care if it's  an Aberrant or what...
We need it to stay here,  and to keep fighting.
That is
our most realistic chance for survival.

D-Don't worry.
It's stronger than an average Titan.
As long as it's out there raising hell,
they won't destroy this building!
How much do you know about that Titan?
We can worry about that once we get out.
You're right.
We'll get out of here first.
We found it!
This is military police stuff...
It was covered in dust.
Are scatter shots really enough?
Will these rifles
actually be of any use against the Titans?
I think they're a lot  better than nothing.
If there are still only seven  3- to 4-meter class Titans in the supply room,
even this may be enough  firepower to blind them all at once.
First, we'll use the lift to
lower a large number of people  through the central ceiling.
They'll fire in the faces of  the seven Titans in unison to blind them.
And then,
the next instant will be critical.
The seven of us hidden  among the ceiling beams
will strike the blinded Titans  in a coordinated ambush.
In other words, in this plan, all of our lives
will depend on this one strike.
The seven must kill seven Titans  at the same time, with a single strike.
The seven will be those of us whose skills  give us the best chance, but...
I'm sorry to make them bear the  weight of everyone's lives...
It's all right.
Regardless of who goes,  everyone dies if we fail.
The risk is the same.
But is the plan I conceived...
really the best one?
It's our only option...
There's no time,
and this is the best plan we'll have.
We just have to give all we've got!
It's fine.
Have confidence in yourself.
You have the ability to  find the right solution.
What?
That ability has saved both Eren and me.
When was this?
The lift's ready!
The guns, too!
They're all loaded!
You just don't realize it.
We'll talk later.
Yeah...
But can we kill Titans  without Maneuver Gear?
Sure, we can.
They're 3- to 4-meter class Titans.
The target will be easy to hit.
Yeah, no matter what the size,
the target is always  that one spot on the neck...
One meter long,  ten centimeters wide!
Or we can shove this up their ass.
These are their only two weak spots.
I didn't know about that!
We can do that?
I'm just finding out now, too.
Reiner...
Those may well end up  being your last words.
It's okay...
Their numbers haven't changed.
We're still a go!
Keep calm!
Draw them in!
Wait.
Avoid fighting from a disadvantage.
If you don't want people to die.
Finish them all with this strike!
Wait.
Ready...
Fire!
Got mine!
And the others?
U-Um...
So sorry to attack...
Shit!
from behind...
Sasha and Connie...
Hurry and help them!
I'm...
So sorry!
Mikasa!
You saved me!
Are you injured?
No, thanks to you...
Then stand.
Sorry...
It was nothing.
Hey, now...
That was close, Annie.
I'm really glad you weren't hurt.
We got them all!
Begin the resupply.
We did it!
Okay, we're saved now.
The Titans aren't coming in!
It's thanks to that other  Titan fighting them.
I accepted defeat before the Titans...
I'm so ashamed!
I'll despise you all you want later!
Let's get out of here!
I don't think I'm cut  out to be a leader...
Don't say things like that again.
I hope you won't get  mad when I say this...
But you aren't a strong person.
So you can relate to how the weak feel.
In addition, you excel in  sizing up any situation.
Isn't that why you immediately  know what should be done?
You gave the right orders.
That's why I could jump,  and it's why I'm alive.
You ready?
Let's get out of here!
We'll all head out together!
Scale the walls!
Rendezvous with the rest of the army! Go!
Mikasa?
Mikasa...
We have to run.
That Titan...
Cannibalism?
Can it not regenerate its body?
I thought that if we could solve  the mystery of that Titan,
it may give us a way  to overcome our bleak predicament...
I agree.
If it gets eaten, we  won't learn anything.
Let's try to keep it alive by  killing the ones clinging to it.
Are you insane, Reiner?!
We can finally get out of here!
What if it might be able to help us?
Might it not prove a greater  weapon than any cannon?
Help us?
Are you serious?
That's...
the Aberrant that ate Thomas...
Come on...
It doesn't need help.
I guess it's finally exhausted itself...
That's enough... We're leaving.
That thing couldn't possibly help us...
A Titan is still a Titan.
What is it?
Mikasa!
It's Eren...
He's regained the limbs he'd lost...
I saw a Titan swallow Eren whole.
I saw...
What happened?
Does this mean
that Eren did all this?
I'll kill every single Titan.
That strong emotion had turned  Eren into a Titan.
But the Garrison decides he  is a threat to humanity,
and turns their blades on him.
Where the Left Arm Went The Battle for Trost (5)
In the year 845...
the Colossal and Armored Titans
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,
along with the life we'd known.
And the insatiable hunger of the Titans  was unleashed on humanity
after a hundred years of deprivation.
No!
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,
losing twenty percent of its population  and a third of its territory,
to retreat within Wall Rose.

You're too slow!
Run, you laggards!
What's wrong, Arlert?
You're falling behind!
Is it too heavy for you?
Will you be the one guy to remove his equipment?
If this were a real fight,  you'd be Titan food by now!
Damn it!
Give me that.
At this rate, we'll all fail out!
We're being graded on this exercise.
If you do that, you'll lose points, as well.
Just don't let them find out!
And don't make me change my mind!
Reiner Braun.
A strong soldier, physically and mentally.
And trusted by his comrades.
I will not slow everyone down, even if it kills me!
Armin Arlert.
While lacking in physical strength,
he's demonstrated an  extraordinary aptitude for his studies.
Annie Leonhart.
Her strike form is flawless,
but she works poorly with others  and tends to isolate herself.
Bertolt Hoover.
He has great potential, but lacks initiative.
Jean Kirschstein.
A master of 3D Maneuver Gear,
but his brash personality causes  friction with the team.
I can't strike as hard as those two,
so I'll have to find the Titan first!
I'll be the one who makes  it into the Military Police!
Thanks, Jean!
I was right to follow you!
Sasha Blause.
She has unconventional, good instincts,
but they make her unsuited to teamwork.
Connie Springer.
He demonstrates superior physical agility,  but lacks mental agility.
They're coming!
Damn.
Mikasa's beat me again in strike depth!
Mikasa Ackerman.
A master of all subjects,
and widely considered  one of the best in our history.
Eren Jaeger.
He has no outstanding talents,
but he's worked harder than  anyone to improve his marks.
And he is more motivated to  attain his goal than anyone.
Ouch...
Sorry, I'm not good at holding back...
Now it's your turn to be the bandit.
What's wrong?
What's the point of this training?
Why are soldiers training  to fight people like this?
Only an idiot would fight an opponent unarmed.
Where's your sense of responsibility?
We're soldiers.
We may be called on to fight at a severe disadvantage,  and retreat will not be an option.
We must be able to handle any opponent,
whether that means using  a cannon or martial arts.
That is our responsibility as soldiers.
Forget all that... Look.
Oh, Annie?
As usual, she's good at slacking off  without getting found out by the instructor.
Okay, Eren...
I think that slacker needs a lesson.
Let us show her what a soldier should strive to be.
You don't want the instructor to  headbutt you again, do you?
If you don't want to get any shorter,
remember what happened when you  came here, and take this seriously.
Hey, isn't that a little harsh?
She's really mad.
I always thought she was scary looking,
but she's way worse when she's really mad.
Let's get going, Eren.
Me?
Annie, you know how to do this, right?
Here I go!
What?
Did she kick my leg?
Can I go?
No, this drill doesn't end  until you grab the dagger.
Wait, Annie.
You're supposed to do this a certain way!
Here.
Now it's your turn to attack me.
No, I...
Go on, Reiner...
Weren't you going to teach her  a soldier's responsibilities?
Yeah.
Sometimes, a soldier can't retreat.
Like now!
That was amazing.
Where did you learn that?
My father.
Your dad taught you that?
It doesn't matter.
There isn't any point in doing this.
You mean this exercise?
Martial arts won't improve your score.
You should just go through  the motions, like them.
The only ones allowed to join the Military  Police and go deep within the walls
are those who rank in the final top ten.
The only ones who take this seriously
are either people like you,  who do whatever they're told,
or real idiots.
Crap, the instructor...
For whatever reason,
the better equipped you are to fight Titans,
the farther you're assigned from them.
Where do you think this farce begins?
I don't know!
Isn't it because that is how humans really are?
Anyway, I'm not stupid enough
to enjoy playing soldiers in this shitty world.
You aren't cut out to be a soldier at all.
I was so focused on getting stronger,  I never even realized...
such an obvious contradiction.
They're honing their Titan-killing skills
so that they'll never need to fight them.
That can't be helped.
Before Wall Maria fell,
only the few in the Survey Corps needed  to know how to use Maneuver Gear.
To save the knowledge base from decline,
{\an8}Just give it one strong blast.
they used the Interior to motivate...
{\an8}Use the generated momentum,  and you'll conserve fuel.
You make it sound so easy.
Well, I guess not everyone can do it...
But it's worth remembering.
If you want to join the Military Police, anyway.
Yeah, I hope I can get in...
I can't imagine a greater honor  than serving near the King.
Hey, Marco.
Cut the noble act and tell the truth!
You want to join the Military Police
because life deep inside  the walls is soft and easy.
No! I really think that...
An easy life, deep inside the walls?
Until five years ago, this was  considered deep inside the walls.
What's your point, Eren?
You don't need to go to the Interior.
You've gone soft enough in your own head.
You...
Don't you think it's strange
that we're training to fight Titans,  just to end up farther from them?
Who cares?
For my own sake, I hope they  keep this stupid system.
You piece of shit!
Shut up! This is reality.
Stop it, Eren.
Stop.
Screw you!
Let go! My clothes will rip!
Who cares about your clothes?!
I'm so envious!
What are you talking about?
That's right, he...
He is who I used to be.
A ranting idiot with no control.
But I'm different now.
I'll use what I've learned  to handle this situation.
What the hell was that?
The martial arts I went through a world of hurt  to learn while you were screwing around.
You think taking the easy way out,  doing as you please, is reality?
And you can call yourself
a soldier?
I heard quite a commotion.
Would someone like to explain?
That sound was Sasha's fart.
Huh?!
You again?
Learn to control yourself.
In the end, two hundred and eighteen trainees  managed to hang on till graduation.
Dedicate your hearts!
Today, you trainee graduates  will be given three choices.
You can join the Garrison,  protecting towns and reinforcing the walls.
Or the Survey Corps, who risk their lives  beyond the walls, in Titan territory.
Or the Military Police, who serve the King,  lead the people, and protect internal order.
Of course, only the top ten students,
whose names were just announced  can join the Military Police.
I finally made it this far.
Now it's our turn
to devour the Titans!

I did it!
I'm joining the Military Police!
We won't go hungry anymore!
How did I score lower than Eren?
Damn it!
You seriously aren't joining  the Military Police, Eren?
You did all that work to make the top ten.
I'd already decided when I began.
I wasn't training to live in the Interior.
I was training to fight Titans.
You'll never beat them!
You do know how many
tens of thousands have been eaten?
We lost over twenty percent of our  population, so we know for sure.
Humans cannot defeat Titans.
So?
If you think we can't win, you'll just give up?
Well...
It's true that humanity has  only suffered defeat until now.
But we didn't know anything  about the Titans then.
Fighting them head-on is pointless.
We did lose,
but the information we gained  gives us hope for next time!
Will we abandon the tactics that cost  tens of thousands of lives to develop,
and let the Titans eat us without a fight?
Hell, no!
I am going to exterminate all of the Titans,
and escape these cramped walls!
That is my dream...
Humanity isn't finished yet!
Wait, Eren!
If you want to go outside the walls, then go.
I'm joining the Military Police, at any cost.
Eren, when you were talking about your dream...
Yeah, I got that from you.
To live outside the walls, not inside.
I'm joining the Survey Corps.
Are you serious, Armin?
You got the best written test score,  so you should use that!
I won't hold you back, even if it kills me.
I'm joining the Survey Corps, too.
Hey, you're the valedictorian...
Join the Military Police!
If you join the Military Police,
then I'll do that.
If you join the Garrison, I'll join, too.
You'll send yourself to an early grave without me.
No one asked you to do this...
I don't want to lose any more family.
They're here!
The main force of the Survey Corps!
Commander Erwin, kill the Titans for us!
Look, it's Captain Levi!
They say he's as strong as an entire brigade.
Shut up.
This is totally different than five years ago...
There are so many people  who have high hopes for the Survey Corps!
Everyone's cheered up.
There haven't been any problems for five years.
And they've improved the fixed cannons.
Maybe the big Titans won't come again.
Right!
You can't seriously believe that,  you stupid lovebirds!
You think we're a happy couple?
You're getting ahead of yourself, Eren!
Hey, you guys!
Hannes!
I heard you graduated yesterday.
Hard to believe you're the  little kids I remember.
What about you?
You've gone from a drunk to a  captain of the combat engineers.
Listen to you...
I'm still sorry
I wasn't able to save your mother.
It wasn't your fault, Hannes.
We aren't ignorant anymore.
I'll never let anything that sad happen again.
We will defeat the Titans.
I don't know whether to be happy  that you've grown up or not.
Don't die.
Huh?
You're joining the Survey Corps?
Connie, you were so eager  to join the Military Police!
I was, but...
Your speech yesterday affected him.
Shut up!
It was my own decision!
No need to feel embarrassed.
It isn't just you.
Thomas...
You can't...
Um, everyone...
I brought meat from the officers' storehouse.
Sasha, do you want to end up in jail?!
You really are an idiot!
Idiots are scary...
Let's all split it...
We can slice it and make sandwiches!
Go put it back!
Yeah...
After all the land we lost,  meat is really valuable!
It's fine!
Once we retake the land, we can  raise cows and sheep again.
I'll have some of the meat, too!
M-Me, too! Get it ready!
I also will, of course!
You guys...
Why are you standing there, Eren?
We need to get back to work, or they'll find out.
It isn't lunchtime yet.
It's been five years since then...
Humanity is finally regaining its dignity.
We can win!
Our counterattack
has only begun!
So hot!
Wh-What is that?
Samuel!
Sasha!
Samuel,
don't move!
That was close...
The wall has been breached?
Not again...
The Titans will come inside the walls again!
I will annihilate all of you!
Annihilate all of you...
Fixed cannon maintenance team 4,
prepare for combat!
Our target is the Colossal Titan before us!
This is our chance!
Don't let it get away!
Hey, there...
It's been five years.
Hell has reopened its gaping maw.
There is no reprieve as Titans devour soldiers.
In the midst of it all,
Eren rescues Armin from death's door, but...

The World the Girl Saw  Battle for Trost (2)
Hey!
Hey! What's wrong, Armin?
Wake up!
Hey!
Armin...
Come on, Armin!
Come on!
Are you awake?
Are you okay?
Are you hurt?
What about your team?
Team?
Get a hold of yourself, man.
Why are you alone?
And what's this weird slime on you?
What happened?
You useless idiot!
D-Die!
Hey...
Calm down, Armin!
Where is everyone?
That's enough, Connie.
They were all wiped out...
All except for him.
Shut up!
Armin didn't say anything about that!
Just look around you...
We don't have any more  time to waste on him.
Why is Armin the only one who made it?
Who knows.
Maybe they thought he was already dead?
It's unfortunate that they ran into multiple Titans.
What a shame that only this loser survived  instead of Eren and the others.
Want me to shut that mouth forever, bitch?!
Stop it, both of you!
No one's thinking straight...
All of our friends are dying so fast.
It would freak anyone out!
That's my Krista.
Once this operation ends, marry me!
Sure...
Her antics are even more off the charts than usual.
Anyway, we can't leave you here.
Can you stand, Armin?
S-Sorry for causing trouble.
I'll go meet up with the rearguard.
Wait...
Armin!
Let's go, Connie!
We have orders to advance!
This is hell.
No, it was always hell.
I just never realized it.
This world has always been hell.
The strong devour the weak.
It's almost as if the world's doing us a favor  by making it so easy to understand.
But, my friends...
They tried to be strong in this world.
They helped me, who was weak.
I couldn't stand that...
To those two, I'm someone  who needs protecting.
I wanted to be strong like them.
To live in this world as their equal!
And this is the result...
Eren died because of me.
Hannah, what are you doing?
Help me, Armin!
Franz isn't breathing!
I keep performing CPR, but he won't...
Franz won't...
Hannah, it's dangerous down here.  Get up on the roof—
I can't just leave him here!
But, Hannah...
Franz is...
Stop it, please...
No more!
I can't take any more...
Hey, do you people have any idea  what situation we're in?
I do, and that's why we're doing this!
If you want to live, help us!
Screw you!
You can't fit that through!
You should let the people through first!
The Titans will eat all of us!
What are you doing, soldiers?
Arrest them!
B-But...
Try it, peon.
I'm boss of the guild here.
Well...
Who do you think paid for all the  food you soldiers crapped out?
Can you get enough money to feed  all the soldiers in this city?
The rest of you, help push!
The stuff in here's worth more
than you'll ever earn in your worthless lives!
Help out, and I'll pay you!
It's okay...
Dad will get the Titans with his cannon.
Mom...
Look.
Push!
If you don't want to die, push!
Please! My child!
Damn it! Why is it ignoring us?
It's an Aberrant!
No point in thinking about it.
It's fast...
We're the best around,  and we still can't catch up!
At this rate...
What are you doing?
Perfect!
You there! Make them help us!
We'll pay you well!
Right now,
my friends are dying.
Because the people haven't evacuated,
they're dying, fighting the Titans.
Of course!
It's your job to sacrifice yourselves
to protect the people's lives and fortunes.
You parasites think you're so special  just because you're finally being useful
for the first time in a century?!
If you expect someone to die  for the sake of another as a matter of course,
I'm sure you'll understand this.
That sometimes a single,  noble sacrifice can save many lives.
Try it!
I've known your boss for a long time...
I can decide your fate with a single word!
How is a corpse going to talk?
Wait!
B-Boss...
Pull the wagon back.
We're saved!
Thank you!
You saved us.
Thank you!
Well done, Ackerman...
I'm impressed.
Thank you, sir.
However,
I was in too much of a hurry.  I ruined my blades in that one strike.
Next time, I'll be more careful.
What happened to you before all this?
No, never mind.
Why would I remember that now?

It's done!
Look, Mom!
Oh, good job, Mikasa.
It's wonderful.
This embroidery pattern has been passed  down in our family for generations.
When you have children of your own,  teach it to them.
How do you get children?
Hmm...
Ask your dad.
Hey, Dad...
Uh, well... Your dad isn't too sure, either...
Oh, Doctor Jaeger's on his way over.  Maybe you should ask him.
Oh!
Looks like he's here.
Coming!
Mikasa?
That's right.
A girl your age.
There aren't any children around here.
Be nice to her.
Depends on how she acts toward me.
Eren...
This is why you only have one friend.
Are they not here?
Mister Ackerman, it's me, Jaeger.
Excuse us...
What's wrong?
Hey... Dad?
She's gone.
Eren, did you see a girl around here?
Have you seen Mikasa?
No.
All right...
I'm going to call the Military Police  and request a search.
You wait at the base of the mountain.
Understand, Eren?
Eren?
Hey...
Can we really sell her?
We killed her parents to get her.
Take a good look at her face.
She's a looker, but she's still a kid.
Not my type.
I wasn't asking about your type.
She's Asian.
Humans used to have races, too...
She's the last descendant
of a clan that fled from a place called "Asia"  to take refuge within the walls.
We'll take her to the capital's underworld  and auction her off to perverts.
The rest of the Asians went extinct...
She'll fetch a high price.
Her father didn't look Asian.
She isn't a pure-blood.
That's right...
The mother was the one really worth something!
And you got scared and killed her!
I h-had to... She was putting up a fight!
Is that all you have to say? Huh?!
Doctor Jaeger, we've been waiting for—
Excuse us.
Stay put if you don't want me  to split your head wide open.
You bitch!
Mikasa, run!
Mom...
Hurry, Mikasa!
Um...
Dad...
Damn it!
Stop struggling!
What are you doing?
I said to just kill the father!
But the bitch...
No excuses...
Grab the girl!
Hey, you'd better not put up a fight.
Or you know what'll happen!
It's so cold...
Excuse me.
Hey, kid!
How did you find us?
Um, I got lost in the forest,  and I saw this house...
A child shouldn't go walking  all alone through the forest...
There are scary wolves in the forest.
But now you don't need to worry!
Just come with us, and...
Thanks, mister.
I've learned my lesson.
Die, asshole!
You're kidding me!
Wait, you damn brat!
You animals!
Die! Die!
This is what you get!
This is what you deserve!
Don't try to stand up again!
It's safe now...
Don't worry.
You're Mikasa, right?
I'm Eren.
Doctor Jaeger's son.
You've met my dad.
My dad and I came to your  house for the checkup.
And then...
There were three of them.
Did you do this?
Did you kill them? Did you?!
I'll kill you... I'll kill you!
Fight...
Fight!
If we don't win...
We'll die...
If we win, we'll live!
What are you thinking, you stupid brat?
If we don't fight, we can't win!
But I can't...
And that was when I remembered...
I'd seen this before...
so very many times.
I'd seen it again and again,
but...
I'd always pretended I hadn't.
That's right.
This world
is cruel.
In that instant, my body stopped shaking.
And from then on, I was in  complete control of myself.
I thought I could do anything.
Fight...
Fight!
Fight!
A single stab to the heart from behind.
Those children did this?
Eren, I told you to wait at  the base of the mountain.
Do you understand what you've done?
I got rid of dangerous animals...
Animals that happened to resemble humans!
Eren!
They would've been long gone  by the time the police arrived.
They wouldn't have got here in time!
Even if that's true,  you were just plain lucky, Eren!
I'm mad because you risked  your life without thinking!
But I wanted to save her  as soon as I could...
Do you remember me, Mikasa?
When you were young,  we met several times.
Doctor Jaeger...
Which way should I go...
to get home from here?
It's cold...
I don't have
anywhere to go home to.
You can have this.
It's warm, isn't it?
It's warm.
Mikasa, come live with us.
You've been through a lot...
You need lots of rest.
What is it?
Come on, let's go back.
Let's go back to our home.
Okay, let's go home.
A cruel world, in which  only the victor survives.
Pull back, Ackerman.
We'll climb the wall.
I'll help the vanguard withdraw.
Wait, Ackerman!
But in this world,
I have somewhere to go home to.
Eren...
As long as I have you,
I can do anything.
"I have somewhere to go home to."
After completing her mission with the rear guard,
Mikasa hurries back to Eren.
But instead, she is told
that Eren has died.
The Small Blade  The Battle for Trost (3)

Eren...
Go, Eren!
Fight!
Huh? Mikasa...
Let's head back.
What am I doing here?
Since That Day
That day, humanity remembered...
It's one of them...
A Titan!
the terror of being ruled by them.
The humiliation of being kept in a cage.
It broke...
a hole in the wall...
They're coming inside!
The Titans are getting inside!
We have to get out of here!
Eren!
My house is over there...
My mom!
Mikasa!
Nothing hit my house!
Once I turn that corner,
my house will still be there!
Welcome home.
You actually worked hard for a change.
I won't let you.
Joining the Survey Corps?  Don't be stupid.
Mom!
Eren...
Mikasa, grab that side!
Hurry, Mikasa!
I know.
Eren, take Mikasa and run!
I want to run!
So hurry and get out of there!
Hannes!
Take the children and run!
Don't underestimate me, Karla.
I'll defeat the Titan, and save you all!
Wait!
Don't try to fight it!
Wait, Hannes!
What are you doing?!
Thank you.
My mom is still back there!
Eren! Mikasa!
You must survive!
Stop!
Hey, what are you doing?
The ship's full!
It's leaving!
You fool...
Where are you aiming?
The gate...
It's closing!
We need to retreat.
We'll be left behind!
Don't close it yet...
Wait a little more!
Many people are still in the city!
Close the gate!
The Titans are coming!
Get that gate shut!
Fire!
It's coming! Run!
It's over...
It's over.
Humanity will be devoured by Titans again.
It's over.
Eren...
The reason you couldn't save your mother
is that you lacked the strength.
I'll kill them all!
I'll wipe every one of them...  off the face of this earth!
{\fad(523,416)}The Year: 850
Today, you trainee graduates will be given
three choices.
You can join the Garrison,  protecting towns and reinforcing the walls.
Or the Survey Corps, who risk their lives  beyond the walls, in Titan territory.
Or the Military Police, who serve the King,
lead the people, and protect internal order.
Now it's our turn
to devour the Titans!
It's been five years since then...
Humanity is finally regaining its dignity.
We can win!
Our counterattack
has only begun!
So hot!
Wh-What is that?
That was close...
The wall has been breached?
Not again...
The Titans will come inside the walls again!
I will annihilate all of you!
Annihilate all of you...
Fixed cannon maintenance team 4,
prepare for combat!
Our target is the Colossal Titan before us!
This is our chance!
Don't let it get away!
Too slow!
You're mine!
Go!
I missed?
No...
The Colossal Titan vanished?
If they make it through,
we'll relive the tragedy that  befell us five years ago!
We stop the Titans here!
But I do have one request.
Please... Don't die.
I'm not going to die.
I can't die here.
Team 34, advance!
Support the vanguard!
An Aberrant!
Stop!
How dare you?!
Eren!
Wait!
I'll avenge Thomas...
I won't let you get away!
Eren!
Why
can't I
move?
Eren!
I can't die here...
Eren! Hurry!
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
Why do they take everything from us?
Our lives.
Our dreams...
Why?
You must master this power!
I won't give up!
I'll eliminate them all...
I'll kill them myself!
I'll wipe them off the face
of the earth.
Every single one!
More...
More...
I want to kill...
A Titan killing another Titan?
Kill...
more...
Eren, don't you know who I am?
It's me, Mikasa!
Your family!
You must use that boulder  to seal the hole!
Move, Ackerman!
What?
What... am I doing now?
Am I sitting?
I can't see a thing.
What day is it?
Where am I?
Hmm?
I'm at home?
I'll go back to sleep.
He will become a Titan,
pick up the giant boulder  by the shattered gate,
carry it over, and seal the hole.
I don't know if I can use the  Titan's power to lift that boulder.
But I understand what I must do...
I must become a symbol
of hope for everyone!
I'll do it...
I'll make this happen!
Armin, that's insane! Stop!
Mikasa, do what you can!
If you go, some lives might be saved!
Leave Eren to me!
Eren, can you hear me?
Come to your senses!
If we don't get out of  here, we'll all die!
Don't let the Titan's body take over!
Just come out of that  lump of flesh, now!
One 13-meter class!
It's approaching Jaeger!
More Titans coming through the hole!
Four Titans, approximately  10-meter class!
Captain, we're finished!
We're the last ones left!
We should recall them  to defend the gate.
Shall I do it?
No.
Shouldn't we order the  elite force to retreat?
No.
Continue drawing the Titans  to the edge of town.
Eren! Get out of there!
Hurry!
Eren! Eren!
What happened to avenging your mother?
Aren't you going to wipe out the Titans?
Don't you hate the things  that killed your mother?
What are you talking about, Armin?
Mom's right here...
Eren! Eren!
Wake up, Eren!
You're still in there, aren't you?
If we stay here, the  Titans will kill us!
Everything will end here!
Like I said...
I don't understand you, Armin.
Why do I have to leave?
Yeah...
Why would I want to leave?
The outside world...
Wouldn't it be great if, one day,  we could go explore the outside world, too?
The outside world!
I am going to exterminate all of the Titans,
and escape these cramped walls!
That is my dream...
Eren... Answer me!
You knew that hell was one  step beyond the walls.
You might die horribly,  like my mom and dad did.
So why did you want to go?
Why?
You know why.
Because I was born into this world!
Eren...
Mikasa!
Armin!
Eren won!
Now he's trying to get the job done!
If we can cover him till  he gets to the gate,
we win!
Defend him at all costs!
Protect Eren until he reaches the gate,  even if it costs you your life!
Don't let any of the Titans near him!
From the time we are born,
we are free...
It doesn't matter how strong
those who would deny  us that freedom are...
Flaming water... Frozen earth...  I don't care what it is!
The one who sees them
will be the freest person in the world!
Fight...
I'd willingly give my life for that!
It doesn't matter how  terrifying the world is.
It doesn't matter how  cruel the world is!
Fight...
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Go, Eren!
Fight!
What am I doing here?
You're so out of it.  Were you sound asleep?
No...
It's just, I feel like I had a really long dream.
What was it about?
I can't remember...
Eren, why are you crying?
Answer up, you piece of crap.
What do you want to do?
I want to join the Survey Corps
and just slaughter the Titans!
The time for dreams is over.
Eren wakes in the dim and damp underground jail cell,
only to face a special military tribunal  that will decide his fate.
Still Can't See  Night Before the Counteroffensive (1)
In the year 845...
the Colossal and Armored  Titans suddenly appeared,
destroying the wall,  along with the life we'd known.
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,
losing twenty percent of its population  and a third of its territory,
to retreat within Wall Rose.
And in the year 850...
The Colossal Titan reappeared  and breached the wall.
And once again, humanity could  not stop a Titan invasion.
Soldiers fell, one after the  next, before the Titan assault.
And then...
Eren! Hurry!
Eren Jaeger had been  devoured by a Titan,
but reappeared, emerging  from a mysterious Titan.
Attention!
Dot Pixis, the high commander  of the southern territories,
recognized the combat potential  of Eren's ability to become a Titan,
and decided to execute  an audacious plan.
He will become a Titan,  pick up the giant boulder
by the shattered gate, carry it over,
and seal the hole.
When this mission succeeds,
humanity will have retaken
its territory from them  for the very first time.
But for humanity, that step will be
a great advance in our  attack on the Titans!
However, as soon as it has begun, the mission  already seems to be on the brink of failure...
Wound  The Battle for Trost (8)
We've somehow managed
to lure most of the Titans  to the town's edge...
But despite our best  efforts to avoid combat,
we've lost around twenty  percent of our troops.
We didn't lose them.
Those soldiers didn't die on their own.
They died due to my orders.
This battle will decide  humanity's survival.
And to win, I am willing  to be called a murderer.
Ackerman!
Hey! Ackerman, stop!
Get away from him!
Eren, don't you know who I am?
It's me, Mikasa!
Your family!
You must use that boulder  to seal the hole!
The mission has failed.
I knew there wasn't any secret weapon.
Eren, you're human!
You're...
Move, Ackerman!
What the?
He's just like any other stupid Titan!
Eren!
Captain Ian!
Two Titans approaching from the front!
A 10-meter and a 6-meter class.
Another from the rear, as well!
One 12-meter class coming this way!
Ian, we must retreat!
Look at him!
No way is that hole getting sealed!
Yeah...
We have no choice but to leave him here.
Red smoke round from the  elite force sighted.
A serious problem has happened  during the mission.
We're dying for no reason.
My friends died for nothing!
Hey! Look at that!
What? What is that?
It... failed?
Why?
Hey, Armin!  Where are you going?
Commander Pixis,
we should recall them  to defend the gate.
Shall I do it?
No.
Shouldn't we order the  elite force to retreat?
No.
Continue drawing the Titans  to the edge of town.
The elite force has full  tactical discretion.
They are not simply excellent soldiers.
They're the best of the best,  entrusted with humanity's fate.
For them to give up so easily  would be unimaginable.
They'll fight to the end...
So the deaths of the fallen will  not have been in vain.
Hey, what's wrong?
Give the order!
Ian, it wasn't your fault!
The plan was always a long shot.
Everyone knew that.
It was worth trying, and we  took our best shot!
Come on! Our squads will climb the walls.
Wait!
Wait...
Calm down, Ackerman.
Riko, your squad will handle the  12-meter Titan behind us.
Mitabi's squad and mine will  take the two in front.
What?
I'm the one they left in charge!
Shut up and follow your orders!
We can't leave Jaeger defenseless.
I'm changing the plan.
We protect Jaeger from the Titans  until we can retrieve him.
He's still valuable as one  of humanity's last hopes.
We cannot just abandon him like this.
We can be replaced, but he can't be.
The failure of that  dysfunctional human weapon
has already cost several hundred lives!
You're saying we should bring him  back, so this can happen again?
That's right.
We must try as many times as necessary,  regardless of the cost in lives!
What happened to Eren?
Armin's headed there by himself.
He's probably all right.
Probably?
He's fine.
I'm sure of it.
Eren can do this.
I think luring the Titans to the  town's edge is useless.
Any fight with Titans  is a war of attrition.
At this stage, they want to avoid  the needless loss of troops.
Then anyone who doesn't make it now  will have died for nothing?
Eventually, it will become an all-out war.
But until then, we must  preserve our forces.
It's obvious that we should  minimize casualties.
The brass made the right call.
Is that so, huh?
It is!
Anyway...
Let's both ensure that we  don't end up as casualties.
Ian, are you serious?
How else should humanity  defeat the Titans?
Riko, tell me!
Is there any other way to get  ourselves out of this mess?
Some way to maintain our human dignity,
without more deaths?!
How can we counter the Titans'  overwhelming advantage over us?
As if I'd know of a way to defeat them!
That's right...
So for the moment, this is  all we can and should do.
We must be willing to sacrifice our lives
and do our best for that  incomprehensible human weapon.
Pathetic, isn't it?
But as humans, it's all we can do.
Now, what will you do?
This is the only battle we can fight.
This is the struggle we've  been allowed to engage.
I can't accept that.
Riko!
I'll obey the order.
I think what you're saying is right.
But as we struggle our hardest,  we'll also show them
how terrifying humans can be.
I refuse to die for nothing.
Leave the 12-meter class  behind us to my squad.
Let's go.
Our target will be the two in the front.
Yeah.
Thank you, Captain Ian.
Ackerman, there's no need to thank me.
I was terrified because there's  no telling what you'll do.
Do as you like, just as  in the original plan.
That will be a more efficient  use of your abilities.
Yes, sir.
You have to protect your boyfriend.
We're family.
What?
The damaged parts aren't regenerating?
Is it due to the earlier damage he took?
What will that do to Eren?
And is there any guarantee  he can regain human form?
No, stop this.
I will not be able to find  answers to these questions.
For now, I'll just do what I can.
Eren...
Mikasa! What happened?

What?
What... am I doing now?
Am I sitting?
I can't see a thing.
What day is it?
Where am I?
Hmm?
I'm at home?
I'll go back to sleep.
Eren!
What are you doing, Eren?
Listen up.
You just need to keep the Titans  in the corner of the city.
Stay focused on that,  and draw them there.
Got it?
You don't need to fight.
Trainees, form groups of three  and run along the ground.
When you reach the wall, jump up.
Don't get killed.
If any Titans break away,  we'll take care of them.
"If"?
Isn't it more of a "when" than an "if"?
If we think we're in danger,  can we deviate from our orders?
If you believe it'll help.
Kirschstein squad, go!
Right!
This is bad! Behind us!
One 13-meter class!
It's approaching Jaeger!
More Titans coming through the hole!
Four Titans, approximately  10-meter class!
Ackerman, take the one behind us!
Got it.
Don't let it near Jaeger!
We'll stop them here!
Right!
Even if they are elite, two squads  can't handle four at once...
No...
Why are there so many Titans?
There aren't too many people there.
Could Eren be drawing them?
Mikasa!
What happened to the plan?
Armin!
What happened to Eren?
It's dangerous! Move back!
Eren is completely unable to enact  his will through that Titan!
I spoke to it, but it  didn't recognize me!
There's no point in anyone else trying!
What about the plan?
It failed.
Everyone's fighting because  we can't leave Eren.
But there are too many...
Before long, they'll wipe us out.
The spot on the back of the neck,
ten centimeters across and a meter high.
Armin!
I'll get Eren out of here!
You protect us from any Titans!
What are you saying?
Eren came out of the  Titan's vital point.
It's probably related to the  mystery behind them.
Don't worry.
As long as I avoid striking  it in the center,
he won't die.
It'll just hurt...
a tiny bit!
Armin...
Armin, that's insane! Stop!
Mikasa, do what you can!
If you go, some lives might be saved!
Leave Eren to me!
Eren, can you hear me?
Come to your senses!
If we don't get out of  here, we'll all die!
Don't let the Titan's body take over!
Just come out of that  lump of flesh, now!
Come out?
Why?
I'm tired...
Eren! Get out of there!
Hurry!
Eren! Eren!
What happened to avenging your mother?
Aren't you going to wipe out the Titans?
Don't you hate the things  that killed your mother?
What are you talking about, Armin?
Mom's right here...
Eren! Eren!
Wake up, Eren!
You're still in there, aren't you?
If we stay here, the  Titans will kill us!
Everything will end here!
Like I said...
I don't understand you, Armin.
Why do I have to leave?
Yeah...
Why would I want to leave?
Why would I want to  join the Survey Corps?
Looks like we have to deviate  from the plan, like it or not.
Gotcha!
So you're finally down, bastard?
Fall back for now!
I'm here.
I'll join up with Mitabi's squad.
What?!
Jean!
Hurry! Go!
I won't let anyone else  die because of me!
Damn it... A malfunction,  at a time like this?
Jean!
What's wrong?
Why isn't he using his Maneuver Gear?
No way... Is it broken?
I'll come up with something!
Damn it.
Why am I the one slowing us down?
Can I really come up with something?
Eren...
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
One day, we're going to explore  the outside world, right?
Far beyond these walls
is flaming water! Frozen earth!
 Snow-white plains of sand!
The world my mom and dad tried to see...
I thought maybe you'd forgotten.
But the reason you stopped mentioning it
was because you didn't want me  to join the Survey Corps, right?
The outside world?
Eren... Answer me!
You knew that hell was one  step beyond the walls.
You might die horribly,  like my mom and dad did.
So why did you want to go?
Why?
You know why.
Because I was born into this world!
Go. Run. Live.
Those words fill the air,
as many lives are lost  on the battlefield.
Eren heads for the gate,  carrying hope with him.
Primal Desires The Battle for Trost (9)
The Survey Corps left to  find a route to Zhiganshina,
but encountered an  intelligent Female Titan.
As soldiers died, one after the next,
they headed into a  forest of giant trees,
none of them knowing why.
If Squad Levi doesn't  defeat it, who will?
Another one's dead...
And maybe we could've saved him!
Choose.
Believe in yourself.
Or believe in the Survey Corps and me.
I'll go forward!
Fire!
He can't intend
to take that Titan alive?
Well, Eren? See that?
We caught that Titan!
This is the power of the Survey Corps!
Don't underestimate us, fool.
Well? Do you get it now?
Yes!
Looks like it's stopped moving...
We can't lower our guard.
But you did well, leading it here.
Men in the rearguard squads died  buying us the time we needed.
We couldn't have done it without them.
Is that so?
It is.
Thanks to them, we'll be able  to see who's inside this thing.
I hope they haven't pissed themselves...
Erwin Smith  57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (4)
An Aberrant?
Or is it like the Colossal Titan?
Did Commander Erwin...
Hey, snap out of it!
Eren, think later.
We need to get farther in and stand by!
Right!
Wait, Levi...
An eye for an eye.
Waves 2 and 3, fire!
Fire the spare rounds!
Um, it's climbing up...
Yeah.
If it gets this far, I'll  move out of the way.
But I don't think it will be long before
they issue withdrawal orders.
Does that have something  to do with the explosions
we've been hearing deep within the forest?
I don't know.
Mikasa, what do you think that sound is?
Are they firing cannons in the forest?
It didn't seem like they'd  brought cannons, though.
It's really loud back there.
Hey, Bertolt...
Do you know where Krista went?
Sorry, I don't know.
I have no idea what's going on.
What am I doing and why?
I want to go home.
We're going to shift position, Armin.
Okay.
They've started to figure it out.
They seem to keep getting better  and better at climbing.
That means, scary as it  sounds, they can learn.
Although some are better  than others, I'm sure.
Armin...
Sounds like something is going  on deeper in the forest.
I think I have some idea what.
They lured that Female Titan all the  way here in order to capture it.
More precisely...
To capture whoever is inside of it.
That was Commander Erwin's goal...
That was his plan from the very start!
Right?
I can see why he wouldn't  have told the new troops.
But why wouldn't he tell you
when you've all been with the  Survey Corps for so long?
Shut up!
Are you saying the Commander  and the Captain don't trust us?
But that's what this means...
Petra, rip out his teeth!
Swap the front and back teeth  when you shove 'em back in!
No, Eren's right.
I think there was a reason the  Commander couldn't trust us.
Like what?
There's only one reason he  wouldn't trust his fellow soldiers.
There's someone who can become a Titan,
or a spy helping them,  in the Survey Corps.
You think so, too, right?
It has to be one of us.
Yes, I think so.
A spy?
Is that possible?
At any rate, the Commander is certain.
I'd imagine the only soldiers who  were told of the plan were those
who've stayed alive for  the past five years.
I see...
So that's it.
Must be.
Understand, Eren?
That's why.
Yeah, if that's the  reason, I understand.
He's assuming that five years ago,  when the first wall fell,
a spy infiltrated our ranks...
And that's how he narrowed  down the possibilities.
Then, the spy killed Sawney and Bean?
Back then, the Commander  asked me about that.
What do you see?
{\fad(1,308)}What do you think the enemy is?
That's what the question meant?
If we could've answered it,
maybe we could've  participated in this plan.
I doubt that anyone could've  back then, though.
I knew.
But I didn't say anything.
Do you know why?
Why?
What, you can't tell?
Well, I shouldn't expect that  much from the likes of you.
You have yet to reach my level.
Hey, are you copying Captain Levi again?
The Captain wouldn't  say anything like that.
If this succeeds, I can get closer  to the truth of this world.
But... Too many died, regardless.
Do you think the Commander was wrong?
I can't say he was right.
If we'd known there was a Titan  informed of our operations,
we would've dealt with  this in a different way.
Your team's squad leader and  the others would've, too.
No, it wasn't wrong.
What wasn't wrong?
How many do you think  died for no reason?
Jean, after the fact, it's easy to say,  "We should've done something else."
However,
no one knows how things will turn out.
And even so, you have to make a choice.
You must.
The lives of a hundred  fellow soldiers...
Or the lives of all the humans  within the walls...
The Commander made his choice.
He chose to let those hundred die.
Eren, you don't know it yet,
but you will soon.
The reason that Erwin Smith is  entrusted with humanity's hope,
the Survey Corps.
Just look at how much  Captain Levi trusts him!
If you live that long...
I haven't lived that long,
but I'm certain of one thing.
If there's anyone who can bring change,
it will be someone willing to  sacrifice what they care for.
It will be someone who can throw aside
their humanity, in order  to defeat monsters.
Someone who can't sacrifice anything
can't ever change anything!

Fire!
How do you like that?
You won't even be able  to scratch an itch now.
You won't be able to make a single move.  Probably for the rest of your life.
They're designed so that the  more you heal your wounds,
the more immobilized your joints become!
But they still can't draw  out whoever is inside?
What are Levi and Mike doing?
It can selectively harden its skin  to protect specific parts of its body?
It's similar to what I've  heard of the Armored Titan.
If we continue using the Maneuver  Gear and blades, will it weaken?
We don't have time to find out.
In that case...
Yes, sir?
Prepare the explosives.
Blow off its hands.
Yes, sir...
But there's a chance  that the amount we carry
has enough firepower to  also blow up what's inside.
Then set them to amputate the wrists.
Set them all off at once at my signal.
Roger.
Hey...
Why not just come out?
We don't have time to waste.
So...
What do you think will  happen to you now?
Do you believe you can escape?
I wish you'd consider all the  trouble we're going through...
As I recall, you killed  my troops in various ways.
Did you find it fun?
Right now, I'm having fun.
Well, so are you, right?
I think you can understand me.
Oh, right...
I wanted to ask you something.
Is it okay if we cut off  your hands and legs?
They'll grow back, right?
I'm talking about {\i1}your {\i0} limbs, not the Titan's.
We need you alive, after all...
Well, that was a surprise.
Were those her dying screams?
Erwin, it stinks.
What direction?
Multiple sources, from  all directions at once.
What's up with them?
They're all running into the forest?
Why did they suddenly start ignoring us?
What?
They're all Aberrants?
It doesn't matter!  Don't let them through!
Begin combat!
What just happened?
Wait...
I've heard that scream before.
In the forests where I'm from...
It's the cry of a cornered animal  that has nothing to lose!
I was taught to exercise greater caution  once a hunt drew to a close!
So be careful?
A hundred times more than usual!
If you underestimate  the forest, you'll die!
I grew up in the mountains, too.
Someone who grew crops  wouldn't understand!
I see.
It's true that Sasha's  intuition is usually good.
Especially when she predicts  things are going sour.
Armin thought Eren would be in  the center, toward the rear...
Ready those explosives, now!
Erwin...
The first wave will come from the east.
They're almost here.
Cart guard team, intercept!
They ignored us?
Are they Aberrants?
Three are breaking through!
Captain Levi!
You just did something,  didn't you, bitch?
So they're after the Female Titan?
Titans from all directions!
All men, engage.
Defend the Female Titan,  even if it means your lives!
It's no use!
Retreat, men!
Back into formation!
Return to Karanes!
We've been had.
Just look at you.
Don't tell me...
The enemy
was willing to sacrifice everything.
I didn't expect the enemy to destroy  itself along with the evidence
by making Titans devour itself.
All our talk at the court martial,  and this is what happens.
If we return empty-handed, who knows
 what will happen to Eren or us.
We can think about that after we return.
Our priority now is getting home  without additional casualties.
For now...
The steam from the corpse is limiting visibility.
It could interfere with our signal  flare message relay system.
I'll call my team.
Wait, Levi...
Refill your gas and blades.
There isn't time.
I think I have plenty.
Why?
That's an order.
Follow it.
Roger, Erwin.
I trust your decision.
We're retreating.
Everyone, retreat.
Get back on your horse, and retreat.
Right!
What? It's already over?
We can go home! All right!
What's going on?
Where's Eren?
Looks like it's over.
Back to the horses! Prepare to retreat!
You heard the man...
Let's go see what the  bastard inside looks like.
Will we really find out who it is?
It's thanks to you.
I didn't really do anything.
You had faith in us.
This is the result of your choice  to trust us back then.
Making the right choice isn't easy.
Hey, don't spoil him, Petra...
What did he do, anyway?
He was pathetic. He just kept whining.
Well, coming back alive on your  first excursion is pretty good.
But it doesn't count  until the mission's over.
Listen, kiddo, the expedition lasts  until you're at home in bed...
Jeez, I know that!
Oluo! Petra!
You guys pissed your pants and  cried on your first mission.
You're all grown up now!
Don't say that!
What if he stops respecting me?!
It's true?
It sure is.
And I didn't, by the way, Eren.
Idiot!
I've killed more of them than you!
More of them than you, idiot!
Kill count isn't all  that makes a soldier.
Shut up, idiot!
Petra...
Does that mean you sprayed  it everywhere while mid-air?
Shut up!
Do you think you're on a picnic?
We're outside the walls!
I didn't piss my pants, either, Eren.
Oh, I'm sure that's the  signal from Captain Levi.
We'll rendezvous with the Captain!
Cut the chatter till we get back.
Erwin...
Why did you order Levi to resupply?
There's no time to waste.
The Female Titan was eaten.
But did you see the  person inside get eaten?
I didn't.
You can't mean...
Yes...
If your original hypothesis was correct,
and they can still move to a degree  after regaining human form...
And if they'd equipped  Maneuver Gear in advance...
The one within the Female Titan  is wearing our uniform right now.
Captain Levi?
No, it's not!
Who are you?!
G-Gunther!
What? Why?
Gunther!
The enemy is now camouflaged  as one of our men.
The capture operation has failed.
The Female Titan appears  before Eren once more.
What stands between it and its target
are the master Titan killers,
the Special Ops Squad.
Crushing Blow   57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (5)
Over a hundred years ago,
humanity suddenly found itself  faced with a new predator.
They were far more powerful than humans.
Humanity was immediately pushed  to the brink of extinction.
The survivors built three walls:  Maria, Rose, and Sina.
There, they enjoyed a century of peace.
However...
Where the Left Arm Went  The Battle for Trost (5)
One reason so many soldiers died
in the Titans' attack on Trost
was the absence of the elite Survey Corps.
Only that morning,
they had embarked on  a reconnaissance mission beyond the walls.
They're here!
The main force of the Survey Corps!
Commander Erwin, kill the Titans for us!
Look, it's Captain Levi!
They say he's as strong as an entire brigade.
Shut up.
If they knew how fussy you are,
they wouldn't look at you  with such admiration.
The Titans are right outside...
What kind of Titan will we see this time?
It'd be so great if we saw an Aberrant!
We have one right here.
Huh? Where?
Right here.
Forward!
Survey outlying areas
and establish supply points  that would support a human advance.
Being entrusted with these missions,  the Survey Corps
receives the best  humanity has to offer.
The military genius of a select few
within their ranks has greatly  boosted their survival rate.
But even so, every excursion into Titan territory
costs over thirty percent of their troops.
The difference in strength  between humans and Titans is that great.
Just you wait...
It won't be long
before humanity wipes you out!
We'll be the ones to survive in the end!
Captain Levi will...
kill you all!
One to the right...
Two to the left.
Captain, I've brought reinforcements.
Petra, tend to the wounded soldiers below.
The rest of you, support the right flank.
I'll take care of the left.
Captain!
It's okay!
I won't hurt you.
So close!
Now it's my turn.
There!
See?
That didn't hurt, did it?
You all have...
the stupidest expressions.
Whoa.
Stay put.
Otherwise, it will get messy...
when I slice you.
Damn.
Filthy...
Captain,
the bleeding won't stop...
Captain...
What is it?
W-Was I able...
to help humanity?
Or will I die,
never having been of any use at all?
You have done a great deal.
And you will continue to do so.
The resolve you leave behind  will give me strength.
I promise you...
I will obliterate the Titans!
Captain...
He's gone.
Did he hear me to the very end?
Yes.
I'm sure he did.
Look.
He seems so at peace...
Very well, then.
Levi!
We're pulling back.
Pulling back?
We have yet to push ourselves to the limit.
Are my men dying for nothing?
The Titans are heading north, toward town.
Just like five years ago...
Something is happening in town.
The wall...
may have fallen.
{\fad(908,1)}Damn it!
Damn it...
It wasn't...
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
We had changed over the past five years...
We trained as hard as we could.
We thought long and hard.
It was all to defeat them...
So that they wouldn't take  anything else from us.
It's hot.
It's so hot...
Save me, Mother.
Mother?
Mother...
Mother?
Save...
Why did this happen?
Why do they take everything from us?
Our lives.
Our dreams...
Why?
Damn it all! Damn it! Damn it!
I won't give up!
I'll eliminate them all...
Every single Titan!
I'll kill them myself!
I'll wipe them off the face
of the earth.
Every single one!
More...
More...
Kill more!
I want to kill...
Kill...
more...
I'll kill them all.
Eren?
Eren!
Eren, can you move?
Can you understand what I'm saying?
Tell them everything you know.
I'm sure they'll understand!
Armin?
Hear that?
He said, "I'll kill them all!"
Yes, I heard him.
He's going to devour us.
What are they all talking about?
Are those blades pointed at us?
Those blades are for fighting Titans.
Why are they looking at me like that?
What is this?

{\fad(518,443)}Wall Rose Interior
Trainees, keep your equipment  at hand, and stand by!
And then...
We managed to get some gas,  and retreat from Trost.
So that's what happened...
I'm sorry.
I requested supplies  for everyone many times, but...
And we finally managed  to get some gas, too.
Th-Then does that mean that  everyone who isn't here...
Yeah.
Even Mikasa?
N-No...
I thought Mikasa came back  later with Jean and the rest.
Jean, don't tell me Mikasa was injured.
Hey, what's wrong?
We've been ordered to keep it a secret.
I can't discuss it.
Keep it a secret?
What?
Of course, it won't stay secret for long...
Before long, all humanity  will know about it.
Assuming humanity lasts that long....
A fortification of flesh, made from Titans.
The engineers are pretty smart.
But we can't lower our guard.
We stand at the front lines of the war  between humanity and the Titans...
at the precipice.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
It won't interfere with the mission.
But I'm worried about my  friends in the vanguard.
The messenger I just saw on  his way to HQ looked pale.
Yeah,
but we simply need to fend off  the Titans, just as we trained.
Captain Hannes, I heard that the three  children who escaped with you
five years ago are trainees now.
Were they in the vanguard?
Yes.
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said anything.
They're safe.
They're tough.
Each possesses a means of survival.
One excels in combat.
One has formidable resolve.
And one has a brilliant mind.
They're safe.
I know they've survived.
Trainee Jaeger!
As well as Trainees Ackerman and Arlert...
What you're doing right now  is an act of treason!
We may decide to kill you on the spot!
If you attempt to lie to us,  or make a single move,
we will fire an HE Projectile at you immediately.
We will not hesitate!
Huh?
Answer me at once!
What are you?!
Are you a man? Or a Titan?
What kind of question is that?
Why look at me like that?
Looking at me  as if I'm a monster...
Is that what they think I am?
I d-don't understand the question!
He's pretending to know nothing?
Monster!
Try that again, and I'll blow you to pieces.
It just takes an instant!
You won't have time to reveal your true form!
True form?
Plenty of people saw you,
as you emerged from within a Titan!
Humanity has permitted an unknown  creature like you to infiltrate Wall Rose!
Even if you are trainees  given to us by the King,
the safest course is to  eliminate the risk immediately!
My thinking is correct!
The Armored Titan that destroyed Wall  Maria could appear at any minute.
Right now, humanity is at risk of annihilation!
Do you understand?
We can't waste more time or troops on you!
I will fire an HE Projectile  at you without hesitation!
It's true that they aren't being cooperative.
We aren't likely to get  any useful information out of them.
You're right, Sir.  We're wasting time and troops.
Captain, this is our chance!
If we dismember him while he  pretends to be human...
My specialty is
tearing through flesh.
If necessary, I am willing to  demonstrate at any time.
If anyone would like to experience it firsthand,
I invite them to be the first to approach.
Captain, Mikasa Ackerman was  in the rearguard with us.
She is worth a hundred other soldiers.
Her loss would be a critical blow to humanity.
Hey...
Mikasa... Armin!  What's going on here?
Mikasa!
You can't fight another human!
Where could we run  within these cramped walls?
It doesn't matter who I must fight.
I won't let anyone kill Eren.
I don't need any other reason.
Let's talk this through!
No one knows what's going on,
so they're ruled by fear!
Am I the only one who thinks I'm not a Titan?
Damn it.
I don't remember how I got here!
I'm too exhausted to move,
and if I say anything, they'll probably kill me.
Killed by a human?
That's ridiculous!
What is this about, anyway?
I came out of a Titan?
What are they talking about?!  What the hell is going on?!
Wasn't that a dream?
If it wasn't...
Then my arm regrew where  my clothes are missing...
That'd make me just like a Titan!
That's impossible...
Why would I...
Why?
I'll ask you once more!
What are you?!
I can't screw up my answer...
I wouldn't be the only one to die.
That's right.
I've always been
just like everyone else...
A human!
I see...
Then don't hate me for this.
There's no avoiding it.
No one can prove
that they are not the devil.
Eren! Armin!
We're going up!
Stop!
Eren...
When I get back,
I'll show you what I've kept secret  in the basement all this time.
Never let go of this key.
And every time you see it,
remember that you must  go to the basement!
This shot will impair your memory.
That's why I can't explain now...
Listen to me.
Take back Wall Maria and reach the basement.
This power will help you then!
Their memories will tell you how to use it.
Eren!
If you get to the basement someday,  you'll learn the truth...
The path will be harsh and cruel,  but you must make it there!
If you want to save Mikasa,  Armin, and everyone else,
you must master this power!
Did we get him?
No...
"Eren is not an enemy of humanity."
Armin puts his life on the line  to plead for Eren.
However, consumed by terror,  the Garrison is incapable of rational thought
and orders Eren's execution.
Response  The Battle for Trost (6)
Attention!
I shall now explain the  plan to retake Trost.
Let me introduce you to
Eren Jaeger, from the Trainee Corps.
He is the result of a top-secret project
to turn humans into Titans.
He will become a Titan,
pick up the giant boulder   by the shattered gate,
carry it over, and seal the hole.
Your job will be
to protect him from Titans  while he moves the boulder!
When this mission succeeds,
humanity will have retaken  its territory from them
for the very first time.
Compared to all that humanity has lost,  it may seem insignificant.
But for humanity,
that step will be a great advance in
our attack on the Titans!
Eren, don't you know who I am?
It's me, Mikasa!
Your family!
Move, Ackerman!
What the?
He's just like any other stupid Titan!
I'm changing the plan.
We protect Jaeger from the Titans  until we can retrieve him.
He's still valuable as one  of humanity's last hopes.
We cannot just abandon him like this.
Where am I?
I'm at home?
Jean!
Why isn't he using his Maneuver Gear?
No way... Is it broken?
I'll come up with something!
Mikasa!
What happened to the plan?
It failed.
Everyone's fighting because  we can't leave Eren.
But there are too many...
Before long, they'll wipe us out.
The spot on the back of the neck,
ten centimeters across and a meter high.
Eren... Answer me!
You knew that hell was one  step beyond the walls.
So why did you want to go?
Why?
Because I was born into this world!
Eren!
Primal Desires  The Battle for Trost (9)
Damn it...
Why am I the one slowing us down?
Can I really come up with something?
Captain, we're finished!
We're the last ones left!
Fall back to the boulder!
What's the situation?
Five Titans,
coming from the gate.
I can't wait till they're gone! No way!
Jean!
His Maneuver Gear really is busted.
What's wrong?
Crap...
What's wrong with it?
Damn it...
Not now!
Jean, calm down!
Marco?
What are you doing?
Jeez.
Don't be such a pain in the ass!
Damn, why is the trigger  so hard to pull?
Jean!
What are you doing?!
Look who's talking?
Hurry and get out of here!
You're insane!
You're the crazy one!
Can't believe I survived that...
Look at that.
Eren...
Mikasa!
Armin!
Eren won!
Now he's trying to get the job done!
If we can cover him till  he gets to the gate,
we win!
Defend him at all costs!
Protect Eren until he reaches the gate,  even if it costs you your life!
Don't let any of the Titans near him!
Don't let them interfere!
Protect Eren!
You two, head toward Eren.
That's an order!
Got it?
Roger!
Mitabi's squad...
What are they doing?
The Titans won't follow us!
We have to get closer to them  until they attack us!
Look over here, bastards!
If you don't, I'll jab my blade  up your stinking ass!
Here they come!
Two of them are coming!
Run!
Run to the building!
What the...
Going on the ground is suicide.
Without horses or buildings,  they can't fight!
No... Now, it's the only way left...
Follow Mitabi's squad!
Armin, let's go, too.
This way! Over here!
My body feels like it's being crushed...
Mikasa? Armin?
What are you doing?
If you stay down there,  Titans will get you!
Come on, you slowpokes!
Over here!
H-Hey!
Mitabi!
So why did you want to go to  the world beyond the walls?
From the time we are born,
we are free...
It doesn't matter how strong
those who would deny  us that freedom are...
Flaming water... Frozen earth...  I don't care what it is!
The one who sees them
will be the freest person in the world!
Fight...
I'd willingly give my life for that!
It doesn't matter how  terrifying the world is.
It doesn't matter how  cruel the world is!
Fight...
Fight!
Fight!
Fight!
Another Titan?
I'll handle it.
Out of the way!
Go, Eren!
Fight!
Everyone...
You didn't die in vain...
Today, for the first time, humanity  has defeated the Titans!
Yellow smoke round sighted.
The operation has succeeded!
Send more reinforcements!
Evac the elite team!

The rest of the Titans are coming!
Get up the walls!
We'll evacuate after we get Eren.
Armin?
How's Eren?
He's so hot, I can barely believe it!
We need to hurry up the walls...
Part of his body is  fusing with the Titan.
I can't pull him out!
We'll have to cut him out.
Wait!
Eren...
Armin!
Mikasa?
That's...
Wings of freedom...
Hey, brats.
What's going on here?
Afterwards, the sudden arrival and  assistance of the Survey Corps,
along with the efforts of  the Garrison's engineers,
allowed Wall Rose to withstand  the Titans once more.
It took a full day to eradicate the remaining  Titans now trapped within Trost.
The barrage of fixed canon fire  from atop the walls was endless.
HE rounds killed most of the  Titans swarming the walls.
The few surviving Titans were  primarily killed by the Survey Corps.
During that operation, humanity managed
to take one 4-meter class and  one 7-meter class alive.
{\fad(1,413)}However,
207 were dead or missing,  and 897 were wounded.
Humanity had indeed scored its  first victory against the Titans,
but there were too many casualties  for anyone to celebrate.
Hey...
You're...
Marco...?
Trainee,
do you know his name?
I knew I hadn't seen him around...
But this couldn't have  happened to him...
Marco,
what happened?
D-Did anyone...
Did anyone see how he died?
What's his name?
If you know, tell me now.
Do you understand, trainee?
It's already been two days  since the hole was sealed.
And we still haven't finished  collecting the bodies.
At this rate, there  could be an epidemic.
We must avert a second tragedy.
There isn't time to  mourn your friend yet.
Understand?
104th Trainee Corps.
Captain of Squad 19, Marco Bott.
Marco, then?
I'm glad we have a name.
Let's get back to work.
What is this?
Where a Titan threw up.
They don't have digestive organs.
So after they've eaten all they can,  they throw up like that...
That's so...
Damn...
There's no way to identify anyone in this!
I'm sorry...
I'm sorry.
Apologizing won't help.
Just mourn his passing.
Any questions?
The leader of the Survey Corps  strike force, Commander Erwin.
And Captain Levi...
U-Um...
Where
am I?
As you can see, it's an  underground jail cell.
The Military Police has  retained custody of you.
We only recently received permission
to speak with you.
That key...
Yes.
It's yours.
You can have it back later.
The basement of your house
in Zhiganshina, Doctor Jaeger's house,  holds the answer
to the mystery of the Titans.
Is that it?
Yes...
I think so.
That's what my father said.
You have amnesia, and  your dad's missing.
Pretty convenient.
Levi.
We already reached the conclusion  that he has no reason to lie.
There's still so much we don't know.
But right now, we need to  ask what you want to do.
What I want to do?
To get to your house,
we must retake Zhiganshina  and Wall Maria.
The simplest and easiest way  to seal the shattered gate
would be to use your Titan power.
It's likely that Titans  will determine our fate.
The Colossal Titan and the Armored Titan
are the same, in principle, as you.
Your decision is the key.
The key that can save  humanity from despair.
I...
I am?
I'll kill them all!
I'll wipe every last Titan  off the face of this Earth!
Answer up, you piece of crap.
What do you want to do?
I want to join the Survey Corps
and just slaughter the Titans!
Oh?
Not bad.
Erwin,
I'll take responsibility for him.
Convey that to the brass.
It isn't that I trust him.
If he betrays us or loses control,  I'll kill him on the spot.
They shouldn't complain.
Because only I can do it.
I accept your request.
You can join the Survey Corps.
A promise held high.
A hope trampled.
A rage festering deep within.
In a confused haze,  Eren hallucinates about
all that has happened since that day.
Since That Day
Draw your blades.
If we see it, it'll only be for a second.
Go!
It's fast!
In these trees, there's no way to  foresee and evade its attacks!
It'll catch us!
Captain, let's switch to Maneuver Gear!
Captain!
You won't escape!
Reinforcements from the rear!
Captain, your orders?!
Let's go for it!
It's dangerous...
We should kill it!
At this rate, it {\i1}will{\i0} catch up with us!
We kill it here...
That's why we came to this forest!
Right, Captain?
Captain, your orders!
Everyone, cover your ears.
Bite   57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (3)
A noise grenade?
What is your job?
To just let yourself be swayed by whatever  you're feeling at the moment?
No, it's not.
Our squad's job
is to keep the brat from getting  a single scratch on him.
Even if it costs our lives.
It wasn't to keep watch on me?
We keep going on our horses, got it?
Roger!
Keep going? For how long?
And it's right on top of us...
Again!
The reinforcements!
If we don't help, they'll be wiped out again!
Eren, eyes on the road!
Sir!
Keep your pace up...
Stay at top speed!
But, sir...
Why?!
If Squad Levi doesn't defeat it, who will?
Another one's dead...
And maybe we could've saved him!
One's still fighting...
We could still make it!
Eren, eyes back on the road! Keep going!
Are you telling me to look away?
To abandon my comrades and run?!
Yes, that's right!
Obey the Captain's orders!
I don't understand why we're leaving them to die!
Or why he won't explain!
Why?!
That's because the Captain decided  the reason should not be explained.
You just don't understand because you're still green!
If you get it, then shut up and obey!
No...
I can fight on my own.
Why am I relying on others?
I can just fight on my own.
What are you doing, Eren?
You're only allowed to do that  if your life is in danger.
You promised us!
Eren!
You aren't wrong.
If you want to, do it.
I can tell.
He's a real monster.
And it has nothing to do with his Titan power.
No matter what power you use to suppress him,
no matter what cage you put him in,
he will never submit to anyone.
{\fad(1,417)}I just want to slaughter the Titans.
Eren, the difference between your  decision and ours is experience.
But you don't have to rely on that.
Choose.
Believe in yourself.
Or believe in the Survey Corps and me.
I don't know...
I never have.
I can believe in my own abilities
or the choices of companions I trust.
But no one ever knows how it will turn out.
So choose for yourself whichever  decision you'll regret least.
Eren!
Have faith!
I came up with a way that'd only half-kill you.
Sir?
I said I'd only be able to stop  you as a Titan if I killed you.
But this method would only badly wound you.
Of course, it relies on the squad's skill.
The idea is to cut you right out of the Titan's neck.
We'd end up cutting the ends  of your arms and legs off,
but they'd just grow back like a lizard's...
Creepy, really.
Wait.
I don't know how they grow back.
Is there some other way...
So you're saying you don't want there  to be any danger or sacrifice?
N-No...
Then just resolve yourself.
We will, too...
The danger for us is that you might kill us.
So don't worry.
Yes... Understood.
Th-Then, I can do experiments?
It's very risky.
But that doesn't mean that we  can't use him to investigate.
I can be in charge of planning this, right?
Eren, if there's something  you don't understand,
learn to understand it.
It's well worth any risk to our lives.
Ready, Eren?
When it's prepared, I'll use the  smoke round to notify you.
After that, any decisions are up to you.
Roger!
This dried-up well could hold  even a mindless Titan...
Probably!
That's the signal.
Since I sealed the wall, I haven't  tried to control the Titan.
If I lose control, Squad Levi  might kill me this time...
Did he not see the signal?
No...
His ability just isn't that reliable.
Hey, Eren! We're calling it quits for now.
Did something happen?
Hanji...
I can't become a Titan.
So your self-inflicted bite wounds on  your hands aren't healing, either?
No.
If you can't transform into a Titan,
our main goal of sealing Wall Maria is off the table.
This is an order...
Make it happen.
Yes, sir.
Don't let it get you down, Eren.
But...
Well, it just means you're  more human than I thought.
Better than rushing into  something and getting killed.
This isn't meaningless.
Yeah...
We can't be too careful.
Why is everyone so calm?
Are they okay with my being  unable to turn into a Titan?
Are you okay?
Yes...
Hey...
What's that?
What was that explosion?
Why now?!
Calm down.
Captain Levi!
This is...
I said to calm down.
All of you.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Smoke Rounds (1)  Signal rounds fired by small handguns using gunpowder.  A small tube, with the round, is swapped out each time.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Smoke Rounds (2)  The signal color changes per message:  Red — Titan sighted.  Green — Change course.   Black — Aberrant sighted.
What? What was that sound?
Eren...
What's the meaning of this?!
Sir?
Why now? Without permission?
Answer me!
Eldo, wait.
Answer him, Eren!
What are you thinking?
No, that can wait...
Prove you're not our enemy, humanity's enemy!
Prove it! Now!
That is your responsibility!
I dare you to make a single move with that arm!
I'll cut off your head!
I can do it... I'm serious!
Want to try me?
Oluo,
I said to calm down.
Captain, get away from Eren!
You're too close!
No, you're the ones who should get back.
Get back.
Why?!
My intuition.
What's wrong, Eren?
Say something!
Like I said...
No sudden movements!
Prove it to me, Eren!
I said I don't understand.
Answer us! You think we can't kill you?
I'm serious!
Do it now!
Are you even listening?
Okay, let's do this!
Are you humanity's—
Please shut up for a second!
Eren!
Can I touch that arm?!
It's okay, right? Right?
Just let me touch it!
Hanji...
Wait a second!
It's... hot!
Without the skin, it's really damned hot!
Unbelievably hot!
Squad Leader,
you're too reckless!
Hey, don't you feel it's hot, Eren?
How does it feel where the right hand connects?
I really want to see!
That's right...
If I just pull out this hand...
Stupid thing!
Hey, Eren...
Don't do anything rash!
What?!
Wait, Eren... That was too fast!
I still wanted to investigate some things...
Captain...
How do you feel?
{\fad(1,324)}Not... Not so good...
Until I saw that they were actually ready  to kill me, I didn't understand...
That they doubted me so much.
Of course they do.
That's why I chose them.
People say you only truly become a  full member of the Survey Corps
after making it back alive from a mission.
But whenever you fight the Titans,  you never have enough information.
There are too many situations you just  can't anticipate, no matter what.
They've had to cultivate the  ability to take quick action
and to make ruthless decisions by assuming  the worse case scenario.
But that doesn't mean they've become heartless.
It's not like they felt nothing when  they turned their swords on you.
Captain Levi...
Squad Leader Hanji wants to see you.
Take a long crap?
Actually, it was pleasantly quick.
I wasn't sure what to tell the brass.
Well, for now...
Look at this.
A teaspoon?
Yes.
The right Titan hand Eren  created was holding this.
Like this, between its index finger and thumb.
It's hard to imagine that was an accident...
And for some reason,
the heat and pressure didn't  warp the spoon at all.
Anything come to mind?
I was trying to pick it up...
I transformed right after.
I see...
That may explain why you couldn't transform earlier.
"Kill the Titans."
"Block the cannon shell."
"Lift the boulder."
In each case, you had a clear  goal before you transformed.
My theory is
that your self-inflicted injury  probably isn't the sole trigger.
You may need some goal, as well.
It's true that when I turned into a Titan this time,
it was like when I blocked that cannon shell.
But...
I turned into a Titan to pick up a spoon?
What the hell is this?
In other words, you didn't deliberately  change without permission?
No, sir.
Huh? Eh?
Wait, what are you doing?
That hurt...
This isn't easy.
I'm amazed you can bite through, Eren.
We made the wrong decision.
This is a small price to pay.
Not that it makes a difference.
Keeping you under control is our job.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
So don't get cocky!
I'm sorry, Eren...
We've been so jumpy.
You must be disappointed in our stupidity.
However, even so...
We're going to rely on you.  And we want you to rely on us.
So...
Have faith in us...
Eren!
You're taking too long! Decide!
I'll go forward!
Let me go!
I'm sorry!
Target is accelerating!
Go!
We will outrun it.
It's impossible to outrun it...
If we keep running away, it'll stomp us all flat!
But...
We might all die,
but everyone chose to go on,
even if it meant abandoning our comrades.
Captain Levi has been looking  forward this whole time.
And the rest of the squad
believe in him, and put all their trust in him.
I'll believe in them, too...
Like they
believed in me!
Fire!
Advance a bit farther, tether the horses,
and switch to Maneuver Gear.
You guys will be off on your own for a while.
Eldo, lead the squad.
Once you're a good distance away  from the Titan, hide Eren.
Take my horse.
He can't intend
to take that Titan alive?
Well, Eren? See that?
We caught that Titan!
This is the power of the Survey Corps!
Don't underestimate us, fool.
Well? Do you get it now?
Yes!
Looks like it's stopped moving...
We can't lower our guard.
But you did well, leading it here.
Men in the rearguard squads died  buying us the time we needed.
We couldn't have done it without them.
Is that so?
It is.
Thanks to them, we'll be able  to see who's inside this thing.
I hope they haven't pissed themselves...
Erwin Smith's secret plan was  to capture the Female Titan.
The aces of the Survey Corps try  to reveal its true identity, but...
Erwin Smith  57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (4)
You... cowards!
Just shut up!
And bet everything you have on me!
What you need is to be trained  like a dog, not a man.
Then my decision is made.
The Survey Corps gained custody of Eren.
They now prepare for the expedition beyond the walls.
Special Ops Squad  Night Before the Counteroffensive (2)
{\fad(689,1)}Trost
{\fad(460,0)}Former Survey Corps Headquarters
The old Survey Corps HQ...
Originally, it was an old castle we remodeled.
So it certainly looks imposing.
But being so far from the rivers and walls,
it ended up being useless for the Survey Corps.
It was established right after  the Survey Corps's formation,
when ideals were all they had.
But I never imagined that this  giant ornament would end up
being the perfect place to hide you.
Don't get cocky, new kid.
Sir?
I don't care if you're a Titan.
I can't believe Captain Levi will spend  all his time with a brat like you...
It's no wonder you bit your tongue,  talking up a storm while riding a horse!
First impressions are important.
The new kid almost pissed his pants.
I think he was just surprised  by how dumb you are.
Either way, my plan worked.
You didn't always talk like that, did you?
If...
If you're seriously doing it to imitate  Captain Levi, please stop.
You aren't like him in the slightest.
Trying to bind my hands, Petra?
You haven't followed all the  necessary steps to become my wife.
I wish you'd bitten through  your tongue and died.
Going on and on about how  many Titans you've killed...
Don't worry.
I bragged about the rest of you, too.
Those are the members of the  Survey Corps Special Operations Squad.
Also known as Squad Levi.
You're pathetic!
Petra Rall.
Titan kills, ten.
Assists, forty-eight.
Oluo Bozad.
Kills, thirty-nine.
Assists, nine.
By any definition, they're the best.
Eldo Jinn.
Kills, fourteen.
Assists, thirty-two.
Gunther Schultz.
Kills, seven.
Assists, forty.
They're the best of the Survey Corps,
specially selected by Captain Levi.
And...
If I lose control, they'll be the ones who kill me.
Look at all these weeds.
What a mess.
It hasn't been used for years.
Inside, it's probably covered in dust.
That's a serious problem.
We'll begin immediately.
I've finished cleaning the upper floor.
Where should I sleep?
You sleep in the basement.
In the basement again?
Of course.
You can't control yourself.
If you're underground,
we can contain you if you turn  into a Titan while half-asleep.
That was one of the conditions of your coming here.
It's a rule you'll have to follow.
I'll inspect the rooms.
Eren, take over here.
Yes, sir.
You look disappointed, Eren.
Excuse me?
Ah, I'll just call you Eren...  Like Captain Levi does.
Here, he sets all the rules.
Sure, I don't mind...
But did I really look so disappointed?
Your reaction isn't all that uncommon.
He isn't the perfect hero  that people say, right?
The real Captain Levi
is smaller, more high-strung,
and more violent than people  think—an intimidating man.
No, what surprised me was how
closely he seemed to follow orders from above.
Because he's powerful and influential,
you assumed he wouldn't let  formalities hold him back?
Yes.
I thought he wouldn't take orders from anyone.
I don't know the details,
but before, he may have  been just like you said.
Before he joined the Survey Corps,
he was a famous thug, operating  in the capital's underground.
Why would someone like that...
I don't know.
I'm not sure what happened,
but I heard Captain Erwin brought  him into the Survey Corps.
Captain Erwin?
Hey, Eren...
Y-Yes, sir!
That isn't nearly good enough.
Redo the whole thing.
Then, in thirty days, we're going beyond  the walls to set up resupply points?
And we're to bring along new recruits  from this year's graduates, too.
If there will be any new recruits, that is.
Regardless, I believe it's too soon.
Eren's present circumstance  is only a temporary measure.
We must demonstrate to the Center
that he's a benefit to  humanity as soon as possible.
Otherwise,
we'll have the Military Police after us aga—
You're even using that story on me, Erwin?
You're as sharp as ever, Mike.
But not as sharp as you.
I'll tell you when the time comes.
We'll be on standby for a few more days.
I heard we're already planning a large-scale  expedition beyond the walls in a month.
Not to mention, we'll be bringing  this year's graduates along, too.
Is that true, Eldo?
That's pretty sudden.
That Titan attack must've taken  a toll on the new troops.
It probably terrified the brats.
Is that true, Captain?
Making plans isn't my job.
But knowing Erwin,
he has more on his mind  than we could imagine.
It's true that the situation has changed.
I'd thought that all of our sacrifice  thus far to lay a route to retake Maria
had been negated by a single blow.
But now we have an entirely different hope.
I still can't believe it.
But what do they mean when
they say you turn into a Titan, Eren?
I don't really remember what happened.
I was so desperate, I couldn't think...
But the trigger is self-inflicted injury.
I take my hand like this...
Wait... How do I know this?
You know we won't get anything
out of Eren that isn't already  covered in the reports.
But I'm sure a certain  someone has other ideas.
Maybe fiddle around with you,  and even kill you, Eren.
Someone?
Hello, Levi Squad...
How are you enjoying the castle?
You're early.
I couldn't wait any longer!
Squad Leader Hanji?
Hey there, Eren...
I'm in charge of investigating the  two Titans we've captured in town,
and I'd like you to help with  tomorrow's experiments.
I came to get permission.
Experiments?
What would I be doing?
Something totally awesome!
W-Well...
I can't give permission for myself.
I don't have that authority...
Levi, what's Eren doing tomorrow?
Cleaning the courtyard.
Okay, then!
It's settled!
Eren... See you tomorrow!
R-Right...
But what do you mean by  experiments with Titans?
Hmm?
U-Um, what kind of experiments...
Hey, stop... Don't ask!
I knew it.
I thought you looked like  you wanted to hear...
If you really want to hear about it...
That's just fine.
I'll have to tell you...
About the boys we captured.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Wallists (1)  Members of a religious organization that  proselytizes within the walls. They worship  the walls as God, refusing to allow any  changes to them, even for defensive purposes.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Wallists (2)  Since Wall Maria's fall, their numbers have  rapidly increased, as has their influence.
We started by repeating the experiments
from the last five successful captures.
Hi, there!
First, we tested if  communication was possible.
How are you doing?
What's your name?
Does that hurt?
Sir, you're too close!
Hi, there.
Nice weather we're having.
Hungry?
That was close!
Too close!
Sir, it's too dangerous!
Unfortunately, we reached the  same conclusion as before,
that communication was impossible.
But my time with the Titans
has been so fulfilling  that I could almost
 forget the weariness from my daily toils.
Once upon a time, there was  a tribe that ate humans.
I'm not talking about you Titans.
I'm talking about a human tribe.
They hid in a cave,  deep in the mountains,
and attacked travelers on the road,
stealing their valuables  and eating their flesh.
The Squad Leader's started the  usual naming ceremony again.
Yeah, what was it last time?
Chikachironi and Albert.
For twenty-five years,  they kept this up.
They say that there were more than  five hundred victims in all.
That's probably even more than  the number of humans you've eaten.
And they tried preparing them  in a number of ways.
They made steaks out of butts.
Cut thighs into chunks for stew.
They would chop up, knead, and bake  the tougher flesh as mincemeat.
They made sausage of  the blood and organs.
Yes, they were capable of cooking.
That's one difference from you.
But that tribe of cannibals was  captured after a single mistake,
then executed.
Just like you two.
You made the mistake  of attacking humanity,
and you were captured.
And so, I'd like to give you the names  of the male head of that tribe.
You're Sawney.
You're Bean.
But don't worry...
I won't have you executed.
Nice to meet you, Sawney.
And you, Bean.
Let's all be friends.
And so, I named the seven-meter class Bean,
{\fad(1,756)}and the four-meter class Sawney.
Next, we tried cutting  them off from sunlight.
We know that Titans start shutting  down as the night progresses.
So we wanted to experiment to verify
that sunlight was powering them somehow.
There were large individual differences  as to how they were affected.
You did well, Sawney.
Goodnight.
See you tomorrow.
After losing access to sunlight,  Sawney started slowing down in an hour...
You really like to stay up late, Bean.
That's fine... I'll stay up with you.
But Bean was fine for three hours.
I was amazed yet again.
They don't eat or drink.
They have vocal organs,  but they don't need to breathe.
For energy, all they require is sunlight.
What if we deprived them of it  for an extended period?
I am curious, but it wouldn't  do to have them die on us.
We killed the last boys  we caught by mistake...
When we experimented with  cutting off their heads,
we took off the backs of their necks, too.
Chikachironi and Albert  were their names.
Their smiles were so cute.
I feel really bad about  what we did to them.
I never want to feel that way again!
Hanji-san...
And then, we started touching  their bodies directly,
to test their sense of pain!
Sir, you don't need to scream, too!
How can I not?!
Look at how much Bean is suffering...
Bean, stay strong!
Endure it!
We had to see if Titans  had any vulnerabilities
beyond the backs of their necks.
It was an extremely difficult task...
Sawney...
Look, it's gone right into your heart.
Doesn't it hurt?
How does it feel?
Unlike Bean, Sawney was introverted,  and rarely responded.
What?
What's wrong?
Sir, get back!
That was really close, Sawney...
At this rate, you'll really die!
So Sawney isn't good with self-expression.
He just kept trying to bite my head off.
Uh, Hanji-san?
How can you stay so  cheerful around Titans?
I mean,
they've almost wiped us out...  They're our natural predators.
And you've seen what they  can do hundreds of times.
You're right.
I've seen many, many friends get  killed by Titans right in front of me.
When I first joined the Survey Corps,  it was hatred that drove me...
But then, one day I realized it.
It was after I'd kicked away the  head of a three-meter Titan.
It was light... Extremely light.
The Titan's body...
Something that size shouldn't  even be able to stand,
much less walk, on two feet.
That's true of all of them.
I once cut off an arm,
and it didn't weigh nearly  what it should have.
I'm told when you became a Titan,
the body appeared out of thin air.
I believe that
the Titans we see and the  Titans of actuality might
be different things altogether.
For decades, we've tried to fight the  Titans with hatred in our hearts.
I want to try and see them from a  different angle than the current norm.
It may end up not meaning a thing.
But I'm going to do it anyway!
Since I joined the Survey Corps,  it's been one surprise after the next.
Not just Hanji-san...
Everyone here is odd.
It's like a den of madmen...
However...
The Survey Corps is a group of  people who desire change!
Hanji-san...
Could you tell me more  about your experiments?
Really?
Yes!
I think it's best for tomorrow's  experiments if I know the details.
Th-That's true...
Yeah.
There is a lot of stuff I skipped...
I'll give you more details.
But it'll take a while.
That's fine!
When we first captured a Titan,  this was my hypothesis...
And thus, we didn't learn anything  new from these experiments.
You should have learned everything
I just told you when you were a trainee.
You knew all that, right?
Yes...
I knew it all.
So let's go over it once more,  this time adding my own hypotheses.
What?
Um, I think—
First, the Titans...
Is Squad Leader Hanji here?
The test subjects...
Both Titans were killed!
Sawney!
Bean!
This can't be real...
Tell me it isn't real!
Those subjects were very valuable...
Did one of the soldiers do it?
Yeah, we don't know who yet.
They were both killed at the  same time before dawn.
By the time the watchmen noticed,
they'd used their Maneuver  Gear to get away.
So this was a deliberate plan,  involving two or more people...
Sawney!
Look... Squad Leader Hanji's gone nuts.
What is this?
Let's go.
It's up to the Military Police now.
R-Right...
What do you see?
What do you think the enemy is?
I'm sorry to ask something so odd.
The hunt for Sawney and Bean's killers begins.
Meanwhile, Mikasa, Armin, and the other graduates of the 104th Trainee Corps
grapple with their own thoughts
as they choose their affiliation.
What Should Be Done  Night Before the Counteroffensive (3)
Over a hundred years ago,
humanity suddenly found itself  faced with a new predator.
They were far more powerful than humans.
Humanity was immediately pushed  to the brink of extinction.
The survivors built three walls:
Maria, Rose, and Sina.
There, they enjoyed a century of peace.
However...
That Day  The Fall of Zhiganshina (2)
"For till then I was a soul in misery, alienate
From God, and covetous of all earthly things;
Now, as thou seest,
here punish'd for my doting.
Such cleansing from the taint of avarice
Do spirits, converted, need.
This mount inflicts
No direr penalty."
No!
Let me go!
"O avarice!
What canst thou more,  who hast subdued our blood
So wholly to thyself, they feel no care
Of their own flesh?
O avarice!
What canst thou more, who hast—"
Eren, what are you doing?
We were so close  to saving my mom...
Why did you do that?!
We almost saved my mom!
Get a hold of yourself!
Eren!
Eren...
The reason you couldn't save your mother
is that you lacked the strength.
The reason...
The reason I didn't fight the Titan
was that I lacked the courage!
I'm sorry.
Ah, it's happening again.
Hurry!
To the inner gate!
Use all ships at the pier  for Zhiganshina's evacuation!
Hurry! They'll eat you!
There are small areas that protrude,
like Zhiganshina, all around the wall.
Their purpose is to attract the Titans,
thus reducing the cost and  manpower of defending the walls.
After the people of
Zhiganshina had fulfilled their function,  by drawing the Titans to them,
they were forced to evacuate by a single gate.
Don't bring anything aboard!
We're taking as many people as we can!
Armin, sit...
But...
Eren and Mikasa aren't here yet.
There they are!
Eren?
Don't talk to them just now.
Poor kids...  Going by appearances, it must've been bad.
Why are you just standing there?
Hurry!
Where are those cannon shells?!
Hurry!
They're right in front of us!
This just can't be happening...
Oh God, oh God, oh God...
Hey! What the hell?!
Wait!
Hey, what are you doing?
The ship's full!
It's leaving!
Please!
Please, at least take my child!
I'm sorry, but I can't!
Go!
Let him on!
Let us on!
You fool...
Where are you aiming?
B-But this thing doesn't  have that kind of accuracy!
Right now, I don't give a crap...
Just load the next shell!
It's hopeless!
The gate...
It's closing!
We need to retreat.
We'll be left behind!
Hey!
Don't close it yet...
Wait a little more!
Many people are still in the city!
If they break through this gate,
we'll lose more than a single city to the Titans!
We'll lose the entire territory within this wall!
But that doesn't mean we  can let these people die!
Close the gate!
The Titans are coming!
Get that gate shut!
Don't do it!
Hey!
What
is that thing?
Fire!
It's not working!
What is that thing?
It's coming! Run!
The Titan's coming!  It's going to ram the wall!
Close the gate!
The gate...

Several hours after Zhiganshina's  fall on Wall Maria's south side,
the news had spread throughout
the entire human territory.
Is it true?
{\fad(714,1)}Wall Rose, South Side  Trost District
Have Titans entered Zhiganshina?
I can't believe it...
Why would walls that have  lasted a century fall now?
Whether you believe it or not,
there are people out there who escaped by ship.
At least five hundred, I'm told.
The question is if we've lost Zhiganshina alone.
But they would certainly never  penetrate Wall Maria, would they?
At the moment,
we should contact the central  government and await orders.
We cannot handle
an emergency such as this on our own.
E-Excuse me!
A messenger just arrived!
They say Wall Maria has been breached!  The Titans are invading!
It's over...
It's over.
Humanity will be devoured by Titans again.
It's over.
I can never go home...
Why?
{\fad(1,465)}Why did I waste my final minutes with  her having some stupid argument?!
Now she's gone...
{\fad(579,1)}She's never coming back!
Why?
You lacked the strength.
Because I...
Because humans are weak!
Is crying all that we can do?!
I'll kill them.
Eren...
What's wrong, Eren?
Eren?
I'll kill them all!
I'll wipe every one of them...  off the face of this earth!
Eren...
That year, the central government decided  to fall back within Wall Rose.
During that period of time,  the Titans consumed ten thousand people.
Eren... Karla...
Mikasa!
Please be safe.
Eren!
Eren!
Eren!
Dad!
Stop it, Dad!
What are you trying to do?!
Just give me your arm!
No!
After Mom died, you lost it...
Eren!
Let me go, Dad!
This is for your sake!
What are you talking about?
Don't forget the key.
You must get there...
Someday, you'll understand!
Until you do...
Eren, are you okay?
You were tossing and turning.
I feel like I saw my dad...
That can't be.
It was only a dream.
Was it?
Let's go.
They said they're going to distribute food.
This was once a food storehouse.
They're keeping refugees who fled by ship here.
Hey, don't cut in line!
Shut up!
I haven't eaten anything since last night!
It isn't yet certain that we'll survive.
Eren!
Mikasa!
Armin...
Look...
I got here in time.
My grandpa got these for us kids.
Thank you.
What's his problem?
There's nothing we can do...
I don't think there's enough food for everyone.
They say that's all we'll get today.
There are too many refugees.
And not enough food to begin with.
You know the farther out you live,  the less they care, right?
Why do we have to share our food with outsiders?
If the Titans were breaking through anyway,
they should have eaten more,  so there'd be fewer mouths.
Eren!
Now there's just that much less food.
Ow!
What are you doing, stupid kid?
You have no idea...
You've never even seen it!
You've never seen the way they eat people...
Shut up!
I'm sorry!
He's just upset because he's hungry.
That's why he's being so rude to an adult.
I'm r-really sorry!
Jeez...
The only reason you aren't starving  is because of us, got it?
Even a kid should show gratitude!
Right!
Damn it.
No guy like that's looking after me...
I'm going back to Wall Maria.
I'm going to kill all the Titans!
Eren, you aren't serious, are you?
I am serious!
I'm not like them, sitting inside  the walls and acting tough!
I don't need this!
Eren, you'll starve!
This doesn't bother you?!
We can't win until we can stop  depending on stuff from them!
It's impossible!
We can't beat the Titans, anyway.
There's nothing we can do  but live within the walls...
If you do something dumb, you'll die.  Like my mom and dad!
So we should suck up to them instead?
Aren't you ashamed?
Right now... Right now, there's no choice!
That's just an excuse!
Then spend the rest of your  life as cattle, weakling!
Mikasa?
If Armin is a weakling, so are we.
We didn't even run from the Titans  or from the city on our own two feet.
We couldn't even get the food  we're eating today without help.
Anyone so weak couldn't  possibly defeat a single Titan...
What matters is survival.
Just like your mother said.
Mikasa...
Eat... And survive!
I will not let you starve.
Several days later,
refugees were sent in droves to till the wastelands,
to bring in more food.
But even still, there wasn't enough.
And the following year, in 846,
the central government used many refugees
in an operation ostensibly  to recover Wall Maria.
Two hundred fifty thousand, in all...
Approximately twenty percent of the population.
But there were only just  over a hundred survivors.
Their sacrifice alleviated the food  shortage for the rest of us somewhat.
It's all because of the Titans.
If we destroy them,
we can retake our home!
Armin...
I'm enlisting next year.
I'll gain the power to fight Titans!
Me, too.
Armin?
Me, too!
I'll go, as well.
Mikasa, you don't have to...
Didn't you say that it's important to survive?
That's right.
So I'll go, to keep you from dying.
All right.
The three of us.
We now begin the enlistment ceremony  for the 104th Trainee Corps!
I am Keith Shadis, and I had the  misfortune to be assigned
to train you bastards.
And I'm not here to welcome you at all!
Right now, you're mere cattle,  fit for nothing but Titan food!
No, less than cattle...
In three years, we'll take you worthless  pieces of crap and train you!
Give you the means to fight the Titans.
In three years, when you stand before a Titan,
will you still be food?
Or will you be a noble wall, shielding the King?
Or perhaps, one of humanity's  glorious soldiers that slay Titans?
You will decide!
Yes...
That's what I'll be.
And I will kill every last Titan in existence!
A failure as a soldier...
Swearing revenge against the Titans,
Eren becomes a trainee.
But when he fails at basic training,
he must confront a harsh reality.
A Dim Light in the Darkness of Despair  Humanity Rises Again (1)
I knew it...
It's coming!
The Female Titan!
The Female Titan emerged once more,
defeating the elite Squad Levi members,  one after the next.
I will kill it!
Having decided it was his fault for  believing in his companions,
Eren transforms and engages  the Female Titan.
but he suffers defeat, and the  Female Titan takes him.
Give Eren back!
No matter where she goes, I'll kill her,
rip her apart,
and get you out of that filth.
I'm sorry, Eren...
Just wait a little longer...
Wait!
Wh-What are you...
Fall back for now.
The Defeated  57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (6)
Maintain this distance.
It may be tired.
It does not appear to  be going very fast.
He seems to have been bitten  right out of the neck.
Is Eren dead?
He's alive.
The target appears intelligent,
and its goal seems to be capturing Eren.
If it wanted him dead,  it would've crushed him.
The target is fighting to  escape after going through
the trouble of putting him in its mouth.
Its goal may have been to eat Eren.
If that's the case, he's in its stomach.
It's more reasonable to  assume that he's dead.
He's alive!
I hope you're right.
If you'd only protected Eren,  this wouldn't have happened!
I see...
You're the one from back then.
Eren's close friend?
We'll limit ourselves to a single goal.
First, give up on killing  the Female Titan.
It killed many of our comrades!
As long as it can harden  its skin, we can't kill it.
Do as I say.
We'll pin our hopes on  Eren still being alive,
and rescue him before  it leaves the forest.
I will tear away at it...
You draw its attention!
He's fast...
So fast that it has no  time to harden its skin!
We can go for the neck...
It's tired...
I bet it can't move!
I can kill it!
Stop!
Eren!
Hey!
We're getting out of here!
Eren...
I think he's okay...
He's alive!
But filthy.
Forget about it...
We'll retreat.
Don't lose sight of the core objective.
Is it more important  to get what you want?
Isn't he an important friend?
No, I...
They're already coming back?
What happened?
No idea...
But I bet they're bringing plenty  of dead bodies with them again.
Eldo is coming home.
I see.
Think Oluo will have time to come home?
It wouldn't hurt to make  him dinner, just in case.
Gunther's coming back.
I see.
This is the part I never get used to.
No one does.
How are my friends going to die?
How am I going to die?
It's all you can think about.
I try not to dwell on it.
If I pictured how I'm going to die,
I probably wouldn't be able to fight.
Yeah.
You're right.
How long will I stay alive?
You're alive now, aren't you?
For now.
Isn't that a good thing?
You're alive!
Can you say that in front of  the bodies of those who aren't?
I might not be able  to go home anymore...
We're almost done.
There were about five  dead we couldn't recover.
Not even a part of them?
They're the only ones we  couldn't due to the Titans...
It's probably best for the families  that we not bring those back.
Say they're MIA.
Yes, sir.
We saw several Titans near the forest,
but none are headed this way as of yet.
We're moving out now.
Tell all the squads.
Yes, sir.
I cannot accept this, Commander Erwin!
Hey, you...
We should recover them!
Ivan's body was right in front of us!
There was a Titan right next to him...
It could result in another casualty!
If they attack, we can just defeat them!
Ivan's an old friend.  We're from the same town.
I know his parents.
If nothing else, I'd  like to bring him home!
Don't be selfish!
Squabbling kids?
Captain Levi...
If you confirmed he's  dead, that's enough.
Whether you have the body, dead is dead.
It won't change anything.
No...
We'll say Ivan and the  others went missing.
That's my final decision.
Give it up.
Don't the two of you
have any human feelings at all?!
Hey, Dieter... You're going too far!
Information We Can Share So Far:
Survey Corps Wagons (1)  These wagons include a complicated suspension system  of ultra-hard steel that can only be made in factory cities.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Survey Corps Wagons (2)  Wagons hitched to Survey Corps horses travel  around 20 km/h. They can maintain their speed  on various terrain, be it paved or unpaved road.
Titans!
That's...
Dieter!
That fool...
The rear line has sighted Titans!
Onward at full speed!
I don't see any tall trees or buildings.
Fighting out here will be difficult.
We're better off outrunning  them till we reach the walls.
They're going to catch us!
Do we have to fight?
Maneuver Gear has limited  utility in open areas!
And look...
They just keep coming!
Then what do we do?
We...
No! They'll reach us!
I'll get behind them!
I'll draw their attention, then you—
No.
Just abandon the bodies.
They'll reach us.
B-But...
In the past, many bodies  haven't made it back.
These guys aren't anything special.
Are we doing this?
Are we really doing it?!
Damn it...
We have to!
Okay!
Keep going!
As soon as we know where  we are, we will depart.
Stay alert!
We'll have to slightly alter  our route to the east...
Captain Levi...
I...
This proves that they were alive.
To me, at least.
This was Ivan's.
Captain...
We're leaving!
Eren, you should stop  considering the Survey Corps.
What? You're going to tell  me they're stupid, too?
That isn't it...
The Survey Corps is back!
The front gate's opening!
Let's go, Mikasa!
The heroes are back!
These are all that made it back?
Everyone else must've been eaten.
That's what happens when  you go outside the walls.
It's like our taxes all  go to fatten them up.
Eren?
What's wrong?
Eren...
Eren!
Eren...
You shouldn't get up.
Rest.
The Female Titan?
It got away.
Why?
What about the others?
What about the plan?
It failed...
Rest for the time being.
What is this?
Did you save me again?
We're almost to the walls.
Aren't there fewer than  there were this morning?
Man...
Far fewer...
Another disaster.
Just this morning, they left raising a ruckus,  but they're already back?
What was the point?
Who knows?
But judging by the gloomy expressions,
they managed to waste more  of our taxes, if nothing else.
Eren, just bear with it.
So cool!
The Survey Corps is so awesome!
They got the crap kicked out  of them, and they still fight!
Captain Levi!
My daughter is in your squad...
I'm Petra's father.
Before she sees me, I  wanted to talk to you.
She sent me this letter...
She mentioned that you respected her  abilities enough to let her join your squad.
That she was going to devote herself to you.
Well, I guess she's too starry-eyed  to consider how her father feels!
Well, as her father,
I think it's too early for her to marry.
She's still so young, with  so much to experience...
Commander Erwin! Answer us!
Did this expedition learn enough  to justify the number of dead?
Do you think the dead have no regrets?
The expenses and casualties from  the expedition were more than enough
to discredit the faction that had  supported the Survey Corps.
As those responsible, including Erwin,  were summoned to the capital,
it was decided that Eren  was to be handed over.
That day, Annie was part
of the escort guard for Eren and the others,  as they answered a summons to the capital.
Suddenly, Armin appeared,
and asked Annie to assist with  a highly sensitive mission.
Smile  Raid on Stohess District (1)
That day, humanity remembered...
the terror of being ruled by them.
The humiliation of being kept in a cage.
Prepare for combat!
We have one target...
Defeat it, and make this humanity's  first base outside the walls.
Target approaching!
Split into five groups, just as we practiced!
We'll be the decoys!
Attack teams, switch to  Three-Dimensional Maneuver Gear!
We'll strike from all directions at once!
We'll show you the power
of humanity!
To You, 2,000 Years in the Future  The Fall of Zhiganshina (1)
Huh? Mikasa...
Let's head back.
What am I doing here?
You're so out of it.  Were you sound asleep?
No...
It's just, I feel like I had a really long dream.
What was it about?
I can't remember...
Eren, why are you crying?
{\fad(1,807)}The Year: 845 — Zhiganshina District
Listen!
These walls were constructed with God's wisdom!
They were given to us by God himself!
None may defile them!
Don't tell anyone that I was crying.
I won't...
But if you're crying for no reason,
why not have your dad check you over?
No way!
I can't tell my dad about it.
What are you crying over, Eren?
Hannes!
Did Mikasa get mad at you for something?
Why would that make me cry?
And you stink of alcohol!
Oh, come on...
You're all drinking again?
Why don't you join us?
Um, but don't you have work?
Yeah! We're guarding the gate today.
We spend all day here, so eventually,  we get hungry and thirsty.
And the fact that some of what  we drink may be alcohol...
Well, that isn't too big a problem.
Can you fight like that if you have to?
If we have to? When would we...
When else?!
If they breached the walls  and entered the city!
Ow...
Hey, Eren, don't yell like that...
The doctor's son is pretty lively today.
If they ever do breach  the walls, we'll do our jobs.
But that hasn't happened  for a hundred years.
But my dad says that you're in the most danger
when you lower your guard!
Doctor Jaeger, huh?
Well, he's right...
He once saved the whole city from an epidemic.
We owe him more than we could ever repay.
But that has nothing to do with them.
As a soldier, when you go up to repair the walls,
you can sometimes see them,  wandering around outside.
But this wall is fifty meters high.  They can't do anything about it.
Th-Then,
you're actually not prepared to fight them?
Nope.
What?!
Then stop calling yourselves the Garrison,  and become the Wall Repair Corps!
I wouldn't mind that...
But listen, Eren...
If we're fighting,  it means things are bad.
As long as everyone's laughing at us  and calling us useless freeloaders,
that means we're all safe.
Even if we can never leave  these walls for our entire lives,
as long as we eat and sleep, we'll survive...
But that makes us just like...
Just like cattle!
That's a brave kid you have there.
Not like he could do anything  about it, huh, Hannes?
Y-Yeah.
Hey, Eren!
Strange kid.
Does he want to join the Survey Corps?
Eren, you should stop considering the Survey Corps.
What? You're going to tell  me they're stupid, too?
That isn't it...
The Survey Corps is back!
The front gate's opening!
Let's go, Mikasa!
The heroes are back!
Damn it, I can't see!
These are all that made it back?
Everyone else must've been eaten.
That's what happens when  you go outside the walls.
Moses! Moses!
Um, my son, Moses... I don't see him.
Where is he?
This is Moses's mother.
Bring it.
That is all we managed to retrieve.
But my son...
He helped, right?
Even if he didn't do anything directly...
My son's death helped humanity
fight back, didn't it?!
Of course!
No.
Our recon this time didn't...
No,
we never...
Never learn a thing!
It's my fault...
My own incompetence killed our men!
And we still don't even know what they are!
What a mess...
You've got that right.
It's like our taxes all go to fatten them up.
What are you doing, stupid brat?
Hey!
What are you doing, Mikasa?!
Get back here!
Mikasa, you can let go now!
What was that for?
The firewood spilled everywhere!
Eren,
do you still want to join the Survey Corps?
Help me pick these up...
There isn't enough to bother.
Information We Can Share So Far:   About the Walls (1)  Humanity lives within three walls.  The outermost is Wall Maria.  The second, Wall Rose.  The innermost is Wall Sina.
Information We Can Share So Far:   About the Walls (2)  Distance between each is roughly the same.  100km separate Maria and Rose.  130km separate Rose and Sina.  From Sina to the center is about 250km.
Back.
Welcome home.
Oh, Eren!
You actually worked hard for a change.
Yeah...
What?
Your ears turned red.
That means you're lying.
Mikasa helped you, didn't she?
Huh? Are you going somewhere, Dad?
Work?
Yes, I'm going inland to see patients.
Probably for two or three days.
Eren said he wants to join the Survey Corps.
M-Mikasa, I told you not to tell them!
Eren!
What are you thinking?
Do you know how many people  have died outside the walls?
I do!
In that case...
Eren...
Why do you want to go outside?
I want to know what it's like out there.
I don't want to spend my life inside  the walls, not knowing anything!
Also...
If no one carries on their work,
all the casualties till now will have been in vain!
I see.
The ship is waiting.
I'll be going now.
Wait...
You need to talk to Eren!
Karla, human curiosity is not something
you can restrain with a lecture.
Eren...
When I get back,
I'll show you what I've kept secret  in the basement all this time.
R-Really?
Bye!
I won't let you.
Joining the Survey Corps?  Don't be stupid.
Huh? Stupid?!
I think people who're fine being cattle
are way more stupid!
Eren!
Mikasa,
sometimes he doesn't think things through.
When you're in trouble,  you must help one another.
Okay.
What's wrong, heretic?
If you don't like it, hit back!
No way.
That would put me on your level!
What?!
You know what I said is true.
That's why you're hitting me instead of arguing.
Doesn't that mean you admit I win?
Shut your damned mouth!
Stop it!
That's Eren!
The fool's back.
He wants to get his ass kicked?
Let's give him what he wants!
M-Mikasa's here, too!
N-No... Let's get out of here!
They ran away when they saw me!
No, they ran when they saw Mikasa.
Ouch...
Hey, are you okay, Armin?
I can stand on my own.
All right.
So I said that humanity should  go out into the world someday.
And they hit me and called me a heretic.
Damn it.
Why does everyone act like you're  crazy if you want to go outside?
Because staying within the walls has  brought peace for a hundred years.
They're afraid that if many of us  venture out, we'll risk letting them in.
So the royal government declared  any interest in the outside world taboo.
That's our lives we're risking,  so it's our business!
You can't.
No.
Come to think of it, why did you tell my parents?
I don't remember ever saying I'd help.
H-How did it go?
Well... They weren't happy.
I bet.
But you're right.
I wonder about those who think staying  inside the walls will protect us forever.
Mom!
Just because the walls haven't  been breached in a hundred years
doesn't mean they won't be
breached today...
What?
An explosion?
Over there!
I think something fell from the sky!
Hey, Armin!
What's wrong?
What can you see?
No way...
That wall
is fifty meters tall!
It's one of them...
A Titan!
It broke...
a hole in the wall...
They're coming inside!
The Titans are getting inside!
We have to get out of here!
Eren!
My house is over there...
My mom!
Mikasa!
It's all over...
The Titans are going
to take the city!
Nothing hit my house!
Once I turn that corner,
my house will still be there!
Mom!
Mom!
Eren...
Mikasa, grab that side!
We have to get this off her!
Hurry, Mikasa!
I know.
The Titans are inside, aren't they?
Eren, take Mikasa and run!
Now!
I want to run!
So hurry and get out of there!
My legs were crushed by the rubble.
Even if I get out, I can't run.
You understand, don't you?
Then I'll carry you!
Why do you never listen to me?!
At least listen this one last time!
Mikasa!
No...
No!
If you don't go, all three of us will...
Hannes!
Take the children and run!
Don't underestimate me, Karla.
I'll defeat the Titan, and save you all!
Wait!
Don't try to fight it!
She's right.
If it were just the kids, I could save them.
But I'm going to repay that family  for what they've done for me!
Wait, Hannes!
What are you doing?!
Thank you.
My mom is still back there!
Eren! Mikasa!
You must survive!
Don't go...
Stop!
That day, humanity remembered...
{\i1}the terror of being ruled by them.
{\i1}The humiliation of being kept in a cage.
The Fall of Zhiganshina.
All humanity could do  was pray, scream, and die...
Among them, Eren was
the only one to swear revenge.

Smile  Raid on Stohess District (1)
Looking good, Annie!
That's my girl!
What are you doing, Annie?
No breaks!
{\fad(440,1)}Wall Sina  Eastern Walled City
What? You hadn't heard?
That Titan kid and the main leadership
{\fad(484,1)}Stohess District
have been summoned to the capital.
They'll be coming through town today.
I see.
Then I'm sure he'll end up dissected this time.
Either way, I hope things work out,  and that they seal the gate.
Did you say seal the gate?
You still insist on defiling  the gods with human hands?
Maria! Rose! Sina!
Defiling the three goddesses with  human hands is unforgivable!
Those people love the walls,  and worship them as gods.
Stay away from them.
Ah...
I didn't realize any of them were still around.
Damn it.
Only the walls will protect us!
{\fad(528,513)}Military Police  Stohess HQ
You finally woke up.
You look so scary when you sleep,  I couldn't wake you.
Sorry, Annie.
Lately, you've been too lax.
What?
Are you mad?
Well, aren't you a friendly one?
Leave her alone.
Annie's from Trost District.
And she's the only one in this  HQ who's been in a fight.
She just came back from hell.  It'll take her a while to recover.
I get it... You like her.
What's so great about her?
Hitch,
there's only one way a moron like you  makes it into the Military Police.
What's that? I wouldn't know.
Tell me.
Stop it, you two!
Don't bother.
Today, we have a different task for  you than the normal busywork.
That's why I had all of you come here.
It's about the Survey Corps group  that's being summoned to the capital.
They'll be passing through the  city's main street today.
Escorting them is a Military Police HQ job,
so we just need to handle them  as they come through town.
Temporary permission for in-city use of  3D Maneuver Gear has been granted.
You will guard them in tandem  with their own security.
You'll travel by barge to the area  where your mission will begin.
That is all.
May I ask something?
Hmm? What?
What are we protecting them from?
I've never heard of anyone within the  walls acting against the monarchy.
There are minor criminals.
But it's hard to imagine any real organization  unless they were based outside the walls.
And I can't imagine any possible motive.
You're so serious.
Okay, you're in charge of everything.
Here are the details.
We ranking officers are busy.
You guys, handle this on your own.
But don't screw up.
Sorry I held up your game.
Let's get back to it.
Whose turn was it?
Damn! He's just screwing around!
Yeah...
This organization is even more  rotten than I'd imagined.
But of course, that's why I chose it...
But when you're a rookie, they make  you do almost everything.
I didn't know that before.
Scum.
Damn scum who can only  think of themselves!
What are you talking about, Marlow?
Since you chose the MPs, you're no better.
I am better!
I'm not trash like you.
I came here to correct the Military Police.
Wow, Marlow.
I had no idea you were this way.
And how will you do that?
I'll have to work my way up.
When I'm in charge,
I'll fix the discipline issues,  and punish those who are corrupt.
It's simple.
I'll make MP a place for  normal human beings again.
That's all.
The way humans are supposed to be.
Wow, you're the real deal!
And here, I thought you were boring! Sorry!
That's quite a noble goal you've got there.
Good luck.
I'm not so sure.
Huh?
If a "good person" like you ends up in control,
I think that'd be the end for us.
What's this?
You actually have something to say?
I think you're right.
Because you say the right things.
I know someone like that.
Going against the flow takes a lot of courage.
I respect that.
You may just be an idiot, but...
Maybe it's just that the other  guy you know is an idiot.
But I'm not like him.
We've wasted too much time on idle chitchat.
Let's go!
The escort wagons will pass through  the outer gate in forty-five minutes.
When we reach the staging area,  everyone should confirm positions.
Got it?
Uh-huh.
Hey!
What's that?
That's our equipment.
Aren't they taking it deeper within the walls?
But that doesn't explain the  Merchant Association's involvement.
What's going on?
They're selling our equipment  on the black market?
Hey, what about the mission?
Oh, crap... He really is the real deal!
Well, for better or worse, we have time.
Let's enjoy the show.
Okay, let's go get a drink.
What's going on, rookie?  What do you want?
S-Selling government equipment is a crime...
And?
The people's taxes paid  for that equipment, and...
So you're threatening your superiors, rookie?
I'm looking forward to your future.
Go buy yourself a woman, and relax a little.
W-Wait!
Selling government equipment—
H-Hey...
We'll arrest you for opposing a superior officer.
Shut up...
That's illegal...
And no one will care.
Not here!
Could you let him go with that?
I'm sorry... It seems our idiot  is causing problems for you.
We'll teach him a harsh lesson.
Or...
Would you prefer to make a bigger scene?
This is the last time.
Yes, sir!
All right, let's get that drink.
Yeah, it's been a hard day's work.
So do it.
Aren't you going to punish the corrupt?
If you want, I'll help you.
What do you want to eat?
What else?
Meat!
Damn it!
We know you're doing your best, missy.
That isn't true at all...
That idiot you know...
The one you talked about...  Would he have done it?
Maybe.
Then I'm one of those pieces of  trash you were talking about,
the ones who just go with the flow, right?
I don't know.
But isn't that what normal  human beings do, too?
I just want
the weak who do get swept  along with the flow
to be considered human, too.
Annie...
Hey.
You're one of the Military  Police now, aren't you?
Armin...
Information We Can Share So Far:
The Military Police (1)  The Military Police number around 2,000,  but if you add the Garrison under their command,  their actual force is approximately 5,000.
Information We Can Share So Far:
The Military Police (2)  Each walled city has about 200 MP stationed there.  Primary duties are to oversee trainee brigades, monitor  the Garrison, and direct fire-fighting operations.
Why are you dressed like that?
I'm a pack bearer.
I have my Maneuver Gear  hidden under my rain coat.
Look.
What's going on?
Annie, would you assist me  in helping Eren escape?
Escape where?
If you disobey the monarchy,  where will you go inside these walls?
We'll just hide for a while.
I don't intend to fight the monarchy head-on.
It will be reported as a rebellion by  a portion of the Survey Corps.
It'll buy time.
Time we'll spend finding enough ammunition  to counter the other factions at the tribunal.
And we {\i1}will{\i0} find it.
Enough ammunition?
Is something so convenient just lying around?
What's your evidence?
I'm sorry, but I can't say.
Sorry, but I can't help you.
I won't tell anyone, but you'll  have to do it on your own.
Annie!
Please!
Eren will be killed!
Clueless people who only care  about saving their own skin
will unwittingly set humanity on  a path toward self-destruction!
I know I can't convince you.
But even so...
I have to make a big wager!
Of course, I'll do my best to  avoid causing you trouble.
But to get through the  checkpoints within Wall Sina,
I need Military Police help!
This is the only way!
Armin...
Do I really look like such  a good person to you?
A good person?
Well...
I don't really like that term.
Because to me,
it just seems to mean someone  who's good {\i1}for{\i0} you.
And I don't think there's any one  person who's good for everyone.
So if you don't help me...
Then, to me, you're a bad person, right?
Fine.
I'm in.
That was easier than I thought it'd be.
Shh!
That's the Military Police for you.
You can see how hard they work every day.
Stop staring.
Let's just hope they won't find out  that Jean's taken my place.
That won't last long, though...
We don't look alike at all.
It's fine.
Both of you look like criminals,  with the same nasty look in your eyes.
I don't have a horse face like him.
Hey, if I hadn't helped you, how did  you plan to get over the wall?
I was going to use the Maneuver  Gear to get through.
That's insane.
Wouldn't it have been easier to escape  before you'd reached Stohess?
Why here? And why now?
I felt that the complicated  layout of this city
would give us a better chance  at swapping Eren with Jean.
And I thought pretending to go along with it,
rather than an outright opposition,  would prevent suspicion
and buy our escape more time.
I see.
I get it now.
There!
Here?
Yeah, we go through here.
The remains of an underground city
they planned and abandoned  are still down here.
This takes us
close to the outer gate.
Really? Wow!
Annie?
What's wrong?
Don't tell me you're afraid  of dark, cramped places.
Yes, I am.
I'm sure that a brave,  suicidal bastard like you
wouldn't understand how  a weak girl like me feels.
A girl who can spin a man around  in mid-air isn't weak.
Stop being an idiot. Hurry up!
No, I won't go that way.
It scares me.
If we aren't going above ground, I won't help.
What are you saying?!
Get down here!
Stop screwing around!
Eren, don't shout.
It's not a problem, is it, Mikasa?
For some reason,
there hasn't been anyone nearby for a while.
Jeez!
I'm hurt.
When did you start looking at me that way...
Armin?
Annie, why?
{\fad(1,555)}Why did you have Marco's Maneuver Gear?
I remember even its tiniest marks and dings...
because we'd repaired them together.
That's why I recognized them.
I see...
Well... I happened to find it.
Then you killed the two Titans we captured?
Who knows...
But if you thought that a month  ago, why didn't you act then?
Because I still can't believe it!
I wanted to think that my  eyes had deceived me.
And because of that...
But... What about you?
You didn't kill me back then.
And that's why this is happening now.
Yeah, I think so, too.
I never expected you to push me this far.
Why didn't I kill you then?
Hey, Annie...
There's still a chance you're an idiot
who's just going along with this because  you have a shitty sense of humor.
So get down here now!
You can prove something  just by going underground!
Get down here, and prove it!
I can't...
I have failed to become a warrior.
I said this isn't funny!
Let's talk, Annie!
We can still talk—
That's enough.
I can't listen to any more of this.
It's pointless.
I'll tear you apart again, Female Titan!
Armin, I'm glad I could be  a good person to you.
You've won your bet.
But...
This is where {\i1}my{\i0} bet begins!
Eren!
Mikasa!
We were too late!
Annie Leonhart was the Female Titan.
However, Eren is unable to transform  before the Female Titan.
It is because the Female Titan is Annie.
Mercy  Raid on Stohess District (2)
The year 850, in Trost...
The sight of Eren Jaeger unleashing
the power of a mysterious Titan
was more than enough to  terrify his fellow soldiers.
I am a human!
He is not an enemy of humanity!
With my final breath before my death,
I shall wish for humanity's glory,
and try to persuade you  of his strategic value!
As Eren and his friends could do nothing  but argue their innocence,
they were saved by Dot Pixis,
the high commander of the  southern territories.
I think we should listen to them...
Icon  The Battle for Trost (7)
I'll do it!
I don't know whether  I can seal the hole.
But I'll do it!
Well said.
You're a real man.
I'll call my strategists.  We'll develop a plan!
No way.
That idea depends on  so many assumptions,
and he's just going to run with it?
I was just thinking the same thing.
But there's no sense in  doubting his decision.
Commander Pixis must see potential  in something the rest of us can't see.
Something we can't see?
Also, I think there's a bigger  issue that must be addressed
before the plan can be executed.
And the Commander fully recognizes it.
What do you mean?
The Titans aren't our only enemy.
There's no time to waste.
I will need your help, young soldiers.
A plan to retake Trost?
You're kidding...
We have no way to seal that hole.
What is the brass thinking?
Going into Trost would be our deaths!
Since we can't seal the hole,
all we can do is die  defending Wall Rose's gate.
Damn it... They want glory that much?
I have to return to that hell?
No! I don't want to die!
Let me see my family!
Hey, Daz, you're being too loud...
You there! I heard you!
Are you saying you want to  abandon your mission?
That's right!
This is nothing but mass suicide!  It's meaningless!
Have you no respect for  humanity? For order?
If I chose to, I could  execute you this minute.
Go ahead...
It's a hundred times better  than being eaten by Titans!
Stop it, Daz!
No! Let me go!
I won't go back there!
Did you hear that?
Given the circumstances,  I don't blame him...
Hey...
I hope someone rebels over here, too.
I'd at least like to choose how I die.
Hey!
I-It was a joke!
Do it...
Be loud...
And get others to go along!
In the Garrison, plenty of  us aren't happy, either.
We'll take advantage  of the chaos and leave!
Leave and go where?
To see my daughter.
Eventually, this wall will also fall.
They say that before Titans gained  dominion over the earth,
there was endless slaughter of human life
in wars over race and ideology...
Then someone said,
"If a powerful external  threat were to appear,
humanity would cease  its wars and unite."
What do you think of that?
I've never heard that legend.
Sounds naïve...
Almost silly.
You have a warped mind like mine.
Even when that powerful threat
has pushed us to the  brink of destruction,
we still have yet to unite.
No, but it's high time we did so.
Otherwise, we won't  even be able to fight.
Eren?
He's safe, huh?
Focus on the mission?
How dare he address a  superior officer that way?
By the look of it, Mikasa and  Armin must be safe, as well.
But what's Eren doing  with the Commander?
You want some?
Yes, please!
Kill me!
If you're going to  execute me, do it now!
You're sure? I'll do it!
Attention!
I shall now explain the  plan to retake Trost.
For this mission, our objective
is to seal the hole where  the gate was destroyed.
Seal it?
How?
Let me introduce you to the one
who will seal the hole for us...
From the Trainee Corps, Eren Jaeger.
E-Eren!
He is the result of a top-secret project
to turn humans into Titans.
He can create and  control a Titan's body.
Hey...
I have no idea what the  Commander's talking about.
Am I just too stupid to get it or something?
Would you shut up, idiot?
He will become a Titan,
pick up the giant boulder  by the shattered gate,
carry it over, and seal the hole.
Your job will be
to protect him from Titans  while he moves the boulder!
We don't have to fight the Titans?
E-Excuse me.
I don't mean any disrespect by  speaking up to a ranking officer...
No, continue.
Y-Yes, sir.
Titans are typically drawn to pursue the largest number of people.
If we can take advantage of that
to lure them along the walls,
we can draw most of them away from Eren
without engaging them in direct combat.
And by using the cannons against those
lured away, we'll  minimize our own losses.
But since we can't  leave Eren undefended,
a small elite force should protect him.
And we can't avoid engaging the  Titans that come through the wall.
The skills of the elite  force will be critical.
All right, understood.
We'll take that into account  and revise our plans.
But this will only work if  Eren can carry that boulder
and seal the hole.
We are proceeding with the operation  without certain proof that he can.
I cannot help but feel doubt.
Indeed, given the uncertainty  of a crucial element,
I do not relish sending many  men to their deaths.
But I do understand what  Commander Pixis is thinking.
Yes...
The first issue is one of time.
Even as we speak, Titans continue  to enter the town.
The greater their numbers in Trost,  the worse our odds of success in retaking it.
And the higher the chance  of Wall Rose falling...
And one more thing.
There's a limit to how much one  can be motivated by terror.
Lift that giant rock?
Is it possible?
Has humanity finally learned  to control the Titans?
You're lying!
I won't put my life on the line for  a plan I can't even understand!
What do you think we are?
We aren't...
We aren't pawns for you to sacrifice!
A human weapon?
He's lying!
He thinks we're fools!
He's telling us to die here, today!
I'm leaving!
Me, too.
And me!
I'm out of here, as well!
Wait!
You'll get the death penalty for this!
I'll spend humanity's last  hours with my family!
This is bad.
Yes.
If we don't do something,  there will be chaos.
Ready to die, traitors?!
I'll kill you right now!
Here is my decision!
I shall pardon anyone who deserts now.
Once you succumb to the Titans' fear,
you can never fight them again.
Those who have learned  that fear should leave.
And anyone wishing their  parents, siblings,
and loved ones to feel that  fear should also leave!
Daddy!
I can't do that...
My daughter is my...
My last hope.
Let me tell you what  happened four years ago.
About our attempt to retake Wall Maria.
As I'm sure you're all aware,
that operation was no more  than the government's way
of dealing with its inability  to feed all of the unemployed.
It was a culling.
The reason no one speaks  of it is because
by sending them outside  these cramped walls,
we were able to survive within them.
All of humanity, including myself,  bears the weight of that sin!
Because so few escaped Wall Maria,
there was never any open rebellion.
But what about now?
If Wall Rose falls,
the sacrifice will be more  than just twenty percent.
The territory within Wall Sina
won't support even half  the remaining population.
If humanity falls,
it won't be because we were  devoured by the Titans.
It will be because we killed each other.
We must not die even  deeper within the walls.
I beg of you
to die right here!
I don't know if I can use the  Titan's power to lift that boulder.
But I understand what I must do...
It may be a lie,
but I must make it happen anyway.
I must become a symbol
of hope for everyone!

I see you're all here...
You have one mission.
To guard Eren Jaeger,
eliminating any threat that  appears during the operation.
It will be the most dangerous and  difficult task in the entire operation.
It's no exaggeration
to say that humanity's fate  rests on your shoulders.
Commander, may I say something?
What is it?
Does this human weapon really work?
Quiet, Riko!
You don't believe it, either, do you?
Commander, this operation  depends on Eren Jaeger,
and we know nothing about him.
If he cannot function, many soldiers  will have died for nothing.
Well, then...
Do you really enjoy losing to  the Titans that much?
I don't.
I hate losing more than anything.
But unfortunately, I've been  losing for my entire life.
I want to win against the Titans...
I want to beat those giant freaks
more than anything in the world.
S-So do we!
Then betting on him is our only option.
You're right, we know nothing about him.
But he's the only chance we  have to defeat the Titans.
Commander, it's time for the  decoy operation to begin.
Ian Dietrich,
Riko Brzenska,
Mitabi Jarnach...
You are the Garrison's  most elite troops.
I'm entrusting humanity's fate to you.
Yes, sir!
Ian, you take command.
You have full authority out there.
Me?
I have no objections.
Nor do I.
But I'm not capable...
Don't worry.
You're a man who knows his drinks.
You're well-acquainted with  drink both bitter and sweet.
I'm counting on you!
Yes, sir!
Eren, I'm sorry...
I ended up making you  responsible for everything.
It's like I said before.
You have the ability to  find the right answer.
I believe in that.
Eren, I'm going to—
Don't tell me you're going  to come with me.
You've been assigned to the decoy team.
But I can't leave you alone...
If you're alone, you'll—
Enough!
I'm not your little  brother or a child...
I told you that!
Ackerman,
join the elite force protecting Jaeger.
We need your skill.
Let's go... It's time!
Bye, Armin.
Don't die.
Yeah, you neither.
A top-secret human weapon, was it?
As long as you can seal that hole,  it doesn't matter.
Our priority is to protect you.
We're counting on you.
Yes, sir!
Eren, are you feeling okay?
Yeah!
Eren...
I said I'm fine!
Much better than when  we were surrounded.
We aren't playing house here, Jaeger.
I didn't mean...
I can't believe we have to
leave humanity's fate up  to a spoiled kid like you.
Enough, guys!
We'll soon reach the shortest  route to the boulder.
I'm not seeing any Titans...
Everyone must have succeeded  in luring them away.
Listen!
You only need to get them  to the edge of town!
Avoid unnecessary combat!
Listen, Jaeger.
During this operation,  more than just a few will die.
For you.
They will be our fellows,  ranked both above and below us.
As soldiers, they're  prepared to die, of course.
But they are not pawns without a voice.
Wait.
Not yet.
A little more...
Go!
They have names and families.
And all the feelings that those entail.
Alyosha, Dominic, Phine, Isabel,
Ludwig, Martina, Guido, Hans...
They're all humans as  alive as either of us.
I've known some of them  since my trainee days.
And today, many will die for you.
You have a responsibility to ensure that  their deaths will mean something.
No matter what happens.
Never let yourself forget that.
And be prepared to die  for that responsibility.
Right!
I'll do it...
I'll make this happen!
Since the Titans appeared,  humanity has never won against them.
Their continuous advance has meant
humanity's continuous retreat  and loss of territory.
But when this mission succeeds,
humanity will have retaken  its territory from them
for the very first time.
Right here.
Let's go!
This will be humanity's first  victory against the Titans!
Green smoke round, confirmed.
The elite force has begun the mission.
Compared to all that humanity has lost,  it may seem insignificant.
But for humanity, that step will be a great  advance in our attack on the Titans!
I doubt a human of that size
could lift that boulder.
But I believe Eren has the  strength to lead us forward...
Eren?
The operation to retake Trost has begun.
As many soldiers die,
Eren, now a Titan, loses control
and destroys his own head.
The operation seems  to have failed, but...
Wound  The Battle for Trost (8)
Over a hundred years ago,
humanity suddenly found itself  faced with a new predator.
They were far more powerful than humans.
Humanity was immediately pushed  to the brink of extinction.
The survivors built three walls:
Maria, Rose, and Sina.
There, they enjoyed a century of peace.
However...
In the year 845...
the Colossal and Armored Titans,
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,
along with the life we'd known.
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,
losing twenty percent of its population  and a third of its territory,
to retreat within Wall Rose.
In the year 850...
The Colossal Titan reappeared and breached the wall,
allowing the Titans to invade yet again.
Eren! Hurry!
Two hours later, the population had  been successfully evacuated.
No one was lost to the Titans.
No one except the soldiers
who had gone to intercept them.
Eren...
As long as I have you,
I can do anything.
The Small Blade  The Battle for Trost (3)
Wait, Captain!
If the Titans attack,
we supply troops won't be able  to protect this place alone.
Please! Stay here!
Out of the way.
I must organize the reinforcement squads.
Within the inner gate, where it's safe?
What are you trying to say?
This is our procedure!
It is our duty as soldiers  to follow procedure!
B-But if this place falls—
Silence!
Another word, and I'll be forced
to deem you traitors  and punish you right here!
I heard the bell sound a temporary retreat.
Why does no one try to climb the walls?
It's over...
It's all over.
Got it.
What good will that do?
Hey, Jean! What should we do?
There's nothing we can do...
They finally issued the order to retreat,
but without more gas, we can't climb the walls.
So we're all going to die...
Because of those cowards.
The supply team...
What happened to them?!
Were they wiped out?
They're too terrified to move.
I can see why...
But abandoning their mission to resupply us,  to hide inside HQ? Unbelievable.
And sure enough,
the Titans have swarmed them,  so we can't go get more gas...
Then we must take a chance,
and try to destroy the Titans around HQ!
We won't be any worse off than sitting here...
The Titans will be here before long!
And if we keep running,  we'll just waste the gas we have.
Without use of our Maneuver Gear,  we really are done for!
I'm surprised to see you using  your head for once, Connie.
But do you think we can do that,  given our numbers here?
Most of the veterans in the  vanguard were killed.
Which of us trainees could lead  a suicide mission like that?
Well, even if someone could,  we can't fight the Titans.
I bet the gas supply room  is chock full of 3- to 4-meter class Titans.
Obviously, we can't refuel with them around.
So we're doomed?
What a stupid life...
If I'd known this would happen,  I would've told them.
Let's do it, guys!
Come on, stand up...
If we all work together, we'll be fine!
I'll take the lead.
Armin, let's all...
Reiner,
what should we do?
Nothing yet.
If we do it, we do it all together.
It's hopeless...
There's no way any of us can  make it out of this town alive.
I knew I could die...
But what am I dying for?
Mikasa?
I thought you were with the rearguard.
Annie!
I have a basic idea of what's happening.
And I'm sorry to involve my personal feelings,
but did you see Eren's team?
I didn't see them,
but no one's made it up the walls.
Actually, Armin's over there.
Armin!
Mikasa!
No!
How am I supposed to face her?
I survived for nothing.
I wish I'd died back there with him!
Armin, are you hurt?
Are you okay?
Where is Eren?
Armin?
The members of Trainee Corps team 34...
Thomas Wagner, Nack Tias,
Milius Zermusky, Mina Karolina...
Eren Jaeger!
These five died valiantly in the line of duty!
No...
Team 34 was almost wiped out, then?
If we try to face the Titans,  the same will happen to us.
I'm sorry, Mikasa...
Eren... He sacrificed himself for me.
I...
I couldn't do anything!
I'm sorry...
Armin.
Calm down.
This isn't the time to get emotional.
Eh?
Now, stand up.
Marco, if we eliminate the Titans swarming HQ,
then we can refuel and climb the walls.
Isn't that right?
That's right, but...
But even with you here, there are too many...
I can do it.
Huh?
I am strong!
Stronger than you guys.
Very strong.
Therefore, I can defeat those Titans!
Even on my own.
You are not only weak,
but you are spineless cowards.
I am disappointed in you.
Just stay here...
Stay here and watch.
Hey, Mikasa! What are you saying?!
You're going to fight all  those Titans by yourself?!
There's no way you can do that!
If I can't, I'll die.
But if I win, I'll live.
If I don't fight, I can't win.
Wait!
What's disappointing here is your vocabulary...
Was that supposed to be  an inspirational speech?
This is your fault, Eren!
Listen up!
Were we trained to let our  fellow soldiers fight alone?!
Do you really want to become cowards?!
I wouldn't want that.
Come on, coward...
Wimp...
Idiot!
Those guys...
Damn it... I'll do it!
Hurry!
Follow Mikasa!
We do this fast.
We need to storm HQ  before our gas runs out!
Mikasa's amazing, though...
How does she move so fast?
No, she's using too much gas!
She'll run out fast!
No matter how good you are,
without the Maneuver Gear, you're helpless!
I knew she wasn't her usual calm self.
She's trying to ignore  her shock by taking action!
At this rate, she'll...
Mikasa!
Damn it!
Jean, you take over.
I'll go after Armin!
I will, too.
What are you doing?
The Titans are still out there!
We need your skills!
Again...
This, again.
I lost my family once more...
Do I have to remember the pain again,
and start over again from here?

It's hopeless...
We can't even get close to HQ.
Not unless we're willing to risk casualties.
Damn! He's out of gas!
Stay back!
Tom, I'm coming for you!
Don't...
It's too late!
Don't—
Why couldn't I stop them?
Why didn't I stop them?
If I had forced them to stop,
this wouldn't have happened...
Do I have the right
to hold a position of responsibility?
No!
Please, no!
No!
I don't want to die!
This world is cruel.
And also
very beautiful.
It was a good life.
What?
Why?
I thought I'd given up.
Why do I keep standing up?
Why am I struggling?
To what end?
There's no point
in living anymore.
What is driving me?
Fight!
{\fad(1,315)}Fight... Fight!
Eren.
Fight...
Fight!
Fight...
Fight!
I'm sorry, Eren.
I won't give up anymore.
I'll never give up again.
Once I'm dead,
I won't even be able to remember you.
So I'll win, no matter what.
I'll live, no matter what!
What happened?
A Titan
killing
another Titan?
Please, Mikasa... Be safe!
Mikasa!
Mikasa, are you hurt?
Are you two okay?
Yeah!
We need to move!
Oh, no! Two 15-meter class Titans!
No, that Titan...
H-He finished it off?
He knew where to hit it, to kill it?
We've gotta move
before it comes after us!
No. It's showing no interest in us...
Even though it should've attacked us by now.
It appeared to know  rudimentary combat skills, too.
What is it?
We just have to assume it's another Aberrant!
We know barely anything about them...
Anyway, let's get to HQ.
Wait!
Mikasa's out of gas.
Huh?!
Hey, seriously?
What are we supposed to do without you?
There's only one thing to do...
I don't have much left, either.
But we need to exchange the canisters, now!
Armin!
There's no other choice!
There's no point in my having them.
But...
Don't waste it this time.
Use it to save everyone.
I led everyone into battle without  being willing to protect them.
And for a minute, I gave up on living,
not feeling responsible  for them in the least.
And all for personal reasons...
I...
Okay, the starter device still works.
I gave you all my blades.
But please let me keep this one.
I don't want to be eaten alive.
N-No...
Armin...
I won't leave you here.
At the time,
I was filled with confusion.
I'd never heard of a Titan  killing another Titan.
I also felt a glimmer of exhilaration.
I felt
the rage of humanity itself  was embodied in what I saw.
A Titan that slays other Titans.
The 104th Trainee Corps members are shocked  into stunned silence by the spectacle.
And soon, they see...
Hearing the Heartbeat  The Battle for Trost (4)
Answer up, you piece of crap.
What do you want to do?
I want to join the Survey Corps
and just slaughter the Titans!
Oh?
Not bad.
Erwin,
I'll take responsibility for him.
Convey that to the brass.
It isn't that I trust him.
If he betrays us or loses control,  I'll kill him on the spot.
They shouldn't complain.
Because only I can do it.
I accept your request.
You can join the Survey Corps.
Still Can't See  Night Before the Counteroffensive (1)
Hey, is there really a Titan that  has sided with humanity?
{\a6}Obviously, it's just a rumor.
{\a6}It's possible the mission to retake
{\a6}our land will fail, and we'll end up with  tons of refugees from Wall Rose.
{\fad(540,0)}Wall Sina Interior
If that happens, we'll immediately  have a food shortage.
Hey...
Maybe that Titan is going to join  the Rose inhabitants and invade us.
{\fad(450,60)}Wall Sina
{\fad(450,60)}Wall Rose
It's amazing!
{\a6}A Titan on our side has appeared!
{\fad(420,0)}Wall Rose Interior
{\a6}Maybe we can even take back Wall Maria!
You could even say...
You could even say he's our savior!
A savior, huh?
Whatever the era, people are so irresponsible.
He'll probably be a pawn in a  revolt against the Center.
Before that happens, we of the Military  Police must eliminate Eren Jaeger.
We can't let those Survey Corps weirdos have him.
Attention!
Salute our commander!
It's hot...
Commander Pixis,
don't you suppose that some
might not approve of the Garrison  Commander meeting privately
with the commander of the Survey Corps?
Ah, you're as stiff-necked as they say.
Don't worry.
I simply happened to run into you
during my morning walk.
And we are merely engaging in  small talk as I enjoy my walk.
Are you aware the Military Police  now want Eren Jaeger, too?
Yes.
I received a message yesterday.
A military tribunal will decide.
Hmm...
Zackley has been authorized to decide whether
the Survey Corps or Military Police get him.
Zackley...
Commander-in-Chief Darius Zackley?
The man who controls all three military  forces: the Military Police,
the Garrison, and the Survey Corps.
His decisions are based only on one criterion:
whether it's good or bad for humanity.
If he thinks Eren is a threat,
he'll order Eren's execution  without a second thought.
Right on the spot.
I don't want to let Eren die.
But sadly, many among the Garrison fear him...
All I can do is refuse to cast my  lot with the Military Police.
Do you think you can win?
No.
But I'm prepared to make a proposal.
Whether it works will depend  on how the inquiry goes.
Then you won't know until you're there?
Our mandate is investigating beyond the walls.
So we never know what we'll see till we're there.
I guess there is more to you than I thought.
It's been an excellent walk, Commander Smith.
Eren's inquisition...
What's it about?
I'm not sure, but I'd guess they're  deciding what to do with Eren.
What to do with him?
Probably whether to kill him or let him live.
Mikasa Ackerman! Armin Arlert!
Are you here?
Yes, sir.
You've been ordered to appear
as witnesses at this afternoon's inquiry.
I'm sorry, but I need the restroom.
You just went!
Please give me some water.
Hey...
Know your place, monster.
Monster?
That's true, but...
But they're so afraid of me,  they have to chain me up?
I guess I understand...
It's not like I know what's happening, either.
Maybe I'm lucky I'm not already dead.
Come to think of it...
Those two weren't ever scared of me.
What are they doing now?
And the others...
What happened to them?
Give us a little more time.
We'll persuade them somehow.
It's been days since then.
What's going on outside?
I won't be in here forever, will I?
So you're Eren, huh?
Are you okay? Anything new?
Sorry to keep you waiting.
But it seems you're finally getting out.
But you'll have to wear these.
I'm Hanji Zoe, a Survey Corps squad leader.
He's another squad leader, Mike Zacharius.
Um...
He has the habit of smelling  people he's just met,
and then smirking.
I don't think it has any real significance...
After all, he's good enough that  they gave him a squad.
Oh, sorry! Too much chit-chat.
We're already here.
Don't worry.
It's actually better not to get  any explanation in advance.
Wait!
I know it's selfish,
but we have no choice but to blindly trust you.
Good luck!
The military court...
This whole time, I was below the military court?
Step forward.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Special Military Tribunal (1)  A military court that judges soldiers  and military personnel. The judge,  prosecution, and defense are all  composed of military personnel.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Special Military Tribunal (2)  Politics have more influence than in a  normal military tribunal.  Darius Zackley, leader of the three  military forces, makes the final decision.
Kneel there!
What's with this lineup?
What are they even judging here?
You guys...
Well then, let us begin.
Eren Jaeger, yes?
You are a soldier, sworn to sacrifice  your life for the public good.
Is that correct?
Yes, sir.
This is an exceptional situation.
This tribunal will be held under  military, not civilian, law.
The final decision rests entirely in my hands.
Your fate will be decided here.
I knew it...
Do you have any objections?
No, sir.
I appreciate your perception.
I will be direct.
As anticipated, concealing your  existence has proved impossible.
We must make your existence  public in some form,
or a threat to humanity other  than Titans may arise.
What I will decide today is which  force will have custody of you.
The Military Police?
Or the Survey Corps?
Then, I ask the Military Police for their proposal.
Yes, sir.
I, Commander of the Military Police,
Nile Dawk, will present my proposal.
After a thorough investigation of Eren's body,
we believe he should be  eliminated immediately.
It's certainly true that his Titan power  overcame our previous peril.
However, now his existence  threatens to spark a civil war.
So we ask him to die for humanity's sake,
leaving behind all the information he can.
There is no need for that!
{\an8}He is an invasive pest!
{\an8}He has deceived the walls that embody God's wisdom!
That's one of the Wallists.
{\an8}He must be killed at once!
Five years ago, no one paid  any attention to them...
{\an8}Priest Nick.
{\an8}Order, please.
But they've gained power.
We'll hear the Survey Corps's proposal next.
Yes, sir.
I, 13th Commander of the Survey Corps,
Erwin Smith, will present my proposal.
We would welcome Eren as an  official member of our forces,
and use his power to retake Wall Maria.
That is all.
That's all?
Yes, sir.
With his power, we can retake Wall Maria.
We believe it is clear what  our priorities should be.
I see.
And where do you plan to begin this mission?
Pixis, the Trost wall has been  completely sealed, correct?
Yes, it can never be opened again.
We would like to set out  from Karanes, in the east.
Karanes District
Trost District
Zhiganshina District
From there, we will proceed to Zhiganshina.
We will determine the route as we go.
Wait a minute!
Shouldn't we seal all the wall  gates once and for all?
The Colossal Titan can only destroy the gates.
If we can strengthen them,  we needn't endure further attacks!
Shut up, merchant dog!
With that Titan's power,  we can return to Wall Maria!
We can no longer indulge your  delusions of grandeur!
You talk a lot, pig.
Where is your proof
that the Titans will wait while we seal the gates?
The "we" you speak of are only those
you wish to protect, your "friends"  who help line your pockets.
The people who starve because  there isn't enough land to sow
don't even figure into the thoughts of you pigs.
We just thought that we could  survive by sealing the wall gates—
Silence!
Impious traitor!
Mere humans altering Wall Rose,  walls that were a gift from God?
Can you truly see those walls,
God's work far beyond human capabilities,
and not understand?
Thanks to them,
{\an8}Humanity is not fit to lay a single finger on those walls!
it took ages before we could even  mount weaponry on the walls.
They have a lot of support and power,  which makes them difficult.
Heresy!
I'll have you be quiet, priest!
What?
Silence.
You may discuss your personal philosophies  and opinions elsewhere.
Jaeger, I wish to confirm something.
Can you continue to serve as a soldier,  using your Titan powers
to benefit humanity?
Yes, I can!
But the report on Trost's defense says this...
"Immediately after turning into a Titan,  he swung his fist at Mikasa Ackerman."
He doesn't remember being unable to control it...
You want me to lie in a report?
Hiding the truth wouldn't help humanity.
Is Mikasa Ackerman present?
Yes, that's me.
You are Ackerman?
Is it true that, as a Titan,  Jaeger attacked you?
Lying isn't going to help Eren one bit.
Yes, it's true.
I knew it... He's just another Titan.
I tried to kill Mikasa?
Me?
But on two previous occasions,
Eren saved my life in his Titan form.
The first time,
mere seconds before a Titan would  have had me in his grasp,
he stood between us, protecting me.
The second time, he saved Armin  and me from an HE shell.
I would like these facts to  be considered, as well.
I object.
I believe these comments are greatly  colored by her personal feelings.
At an early age, Mikasa Ackerman lost her parents,
and was taken in by the Jaeger household.
Our investigation has also revealed
a surprising fact about the underlying events.
At age nine, Eren Jaeger and Mikasa Ackerman
killed three robbers who tried to kidnap her.
Even if it was self-defense,
I must question their fundamental humanity.
Is it right to entrust humanity's fate,  resources, and lives to him?
That's right!
He's just a Titan that infiltrated  us by pretending to be a child!
So is she!
Do we know that she's human?
That's right! Just to be safe,  we should dissect her!
Wait!
I may be a monster, but she  has nothing to do with it!
Nothing at all!
We can't trust that!
It's true!
If you're covering for her,  it means she's one of you!
No!
I mean...
You are wrong.
But you're simply coming  up with theories that fit
whatever it suits you to think.
What did you say?
Besides, all of you people...
Is this smart?
You've never even seen a Titan!
What are you so afraid of?
Should I just keep my mouth shut?
No, I'll tell them everything I'm thinking.
What is the point if those with the  means and power do not fight?
If you're afraid to fight for survival,
then help me!
You... cowards!
What?
Just shut up!
And bet everything you have on me!
Weapons ready!
Yes, sir!
Huh?
Wait, Mikasa!
This is a personal opinion.
But I believe pain to be the  best way to train someone.
What you need is to be trained  like a dog, not a man.
It's easier to kick you while you're kneeling, too.
Wait, Levi...
What is it?
That's dangerous...
What if he gets angry and turns into a Titan?
What are you saying?
Aren't you going to dissect him?
When he turned into a Titan last time,
he killed twenty other Titans before collapsing.
If he is an enemy, his intelligence  makes him a more formidable foe.
Still no match for me, of course.
But what will you do?
Anyone persecuting him should  also consider that fact.
Do you really think you can kill him?
Sir, I have a proposal.
What is it?
The details of Eren's Titan power remain uncertain.
Making it dangerous.
Thus, I propose to have Captain Levi  take responsibility for Eren's control,
and embark on an expedition outside the walls.
With Eren in tow?
Yes, sir.
Based on the expedition's results,
I'd like you to judge whether Eren  can control his Titan power
and whether he is a boon or bane to humanity.
Control Eren Jaeger...
Can you do it, Levi?
I'm certain I can kill him.
The only problem is I doubt I can do any less.
Then my decision is made.
That was really terrible.
It hurts, right?
A little.
So, how does it hurt?
I'm sorry.
But thanks to that,  we had you turned over to us.
Yes, sir.
The pain you endured allowed me to play my cards
at the right moment.
You have my respect.
Eren, I look forward to working with you.
Yes, sir! Thank you!
Hey, Eren...
Yes, sir?
Do you resent me?
N-No...
I understand why it was necessary.
That's good.
But you took it a little far.
You lost a tooth.
See?
Don't pick that up... It's creepy.
Even this is an important sample.
Eren, it's still better than getting  dissected by people like Hanji, right?
I'm not like them...
I wouldn't kill him.
Hey, Eren...
Let me see the inside of your mouth.
The tooth...
It's already grown back.
Eren has finally been assigned  to the Survey Corps of his dreams.
But he finds that the Corps is a group of people
who long for revolution...
Or perhaps it is a den of madmen.
Special Ops Squad  Night Before the Counteroffensive (2)
In the year 845...
the Colossal and Armored Titans
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,
along with the life we'd known.
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,
losing twenty percent of its population  and a third of its territory,
to retreat within Wall Rose.
And in the year 850, in Trost...
Once again, humanity could  not stop a Titan invasion.
Eren Jaeger had been  devoured by a Titan,
but reappeared, emerging  from a mysterious Titan.
Response  The Battle for Trost (6)
I'll ask you once more!
What are you?!
A human!
I see...
Then don't hate me for this.
Marco...
I can't...
I can't fight the Titans anymore!
What happened?
My friends were eaten  right in front of me!
I saw them devoured,
and I didn't even feel sad or angry...
All I could think was,  "I'm so glad that it wasn't me!"
But...
Next time, it'll be me...
I realized something.
Essentially, our job
is to fight the Titans  until they eat us, isn't it?
I'd rather die right now than be eaten!
Stop it...
Get a hold of yourself!
You aren't the only one.
Everyone is struggling with that fear!
Look at Sasha!
Even after what happened,  she is still a proud soldier!
I have a terrible stomachache.
May I go join the wounded?
I can't do this anymore!
Stop it!
Stop!
I guess that gag order  was indeed necessary...
Just look at them now.
If they learn about Eren...
A cannon shot?
Why only one?
Look! Smoke!
From inside the wall!
What?
What's going on?
Did they break through the floodgate?
No way! That's the strongest part...
Someone just screwed up  and dropped a shell.
But why is there so much smoke?
It can't be... A Titan's steam?
Wait!
Hey...
What is going on here?
It's alive...
Captain Wellman!
J-Just look at it!
It's too dangerous to get close!
Maintain your position  and remain on high alert!
Maintain your position!
Have the gunners load another round!
What is this?
I remember hearing the cannon fire...
And then there was a horrible  sound, a shock wave, and heat...
Are we inside a huge skeleton—
Eren protected us.
That's all we need to know for now.
Flowers survived, only inside...?
Hey!
Are you guys okay?!
Eren!
What is this?
No idea...
But this thing will soon dissipate  like any other Titan corpse...
Let's get away from it!
Are they in shock, or just  waiting to see what we'll do?
The Garrison isn't doing  anything right now, but...
They'll attack again before long.
After showing them this, I doubt we'll  be able to talk our way out.
But I do remember one thing...
The basement.
The basement of my house.
Dad said that if I go there,  I'll learn everything.
This happened to me because of him, too.
If I go to the basement,
I'll probably learn what  the Titans really are.
Damn it!
Then why did he hide it?
Isn't that information
what thousands of Survey  Corps soldiers died for?
Isn't it humanity's last hope?
And he's been keeping it locked  in the basement of our house?
What the hell was he thinking?
Where the hell has he been  the past five years, anyway?
Eren.
Right now, we have other priorities.
Yeah.
The smoke's clearing.
When you see them, attack.
Let's end this here.
Don't move yet!
I'm getting out of here.
Where will you go? And how?
For now, I don't care where.
But from there, over the walls,  to the basement.
Once I become a Titan again.
Can you do that?
I don't know how I do it myself.
But I still think I can!
It's similar to the way you can't explain  how you move your own arm.
Back there,
my only thought was stopping that shell.
So that body had no other function and  rotted away after having served its purpose.
This time, I'll turn  into something stronger.
A 15-meter class, like the one  that tore apart those Titans.
Eren.
Your nose is bleeding.
You look pale, and your  breaths are ragged.
Your body is in bad shape!
How I feel doesn't matter.
I've come up with two options.
First, if you don't try to protect me,  at least they won't kill you.
Although I've already  caused you trouble.
I'm thinking of leaving here alone.
No...
I'll go, too—
Eren,
I'm coming with you.
No!
If I can't keep up, you don't  need to worry about me.
But I don't have to do what you say.
I've told you to stop all that!
I'm not your little brother,  and I'm not a child!
Information We Can Share So Far:
Yeast (1)  A special yeast made only within Wall Sina keeps  fodder, wheat, beans, and other items from spoiling  for a long time when placed in storerooms or tents.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Yeast (2)  By seeding storage caches with  this yeast along supply lanes,  humanity prepares to retake Wall Maria.
Captain, the next round  will be loaded soon.
Should we attack again?
Wait for my signal!
Yes, sir.
The Garrison's giving no indication of  moving to attack with their blades.
Mikasa's more sensitive than  a stray cat to those things.
Loading the next round will probably take
a minimum of another twenty seconds.
Before then, Eren will have  made his move and left...
Why would I remember these  things at a time like this?
Is it because this is it for us?
And at the end, I was
nothing more than a coward, after all...
They saved me over and over,
but I was never able to save them.
As a friend, how can I stand  on equal ground with them?
How could I say I'd go with them?
When even I'm not sure I can?
Now, the three of us
will probably never  be together again...
Eren, I...
Wait, Mikasa.
I said I've come up with two options.
Armin,
I'll let you decide.
Huh?
I know what I've just  said isn't that realistic.
The smartest thing to do
would be to stay with the troops  and use this ability strategically.
I know it's crazy...
But if you think you can convince  the Garrison I'm not a threat right now,
I will trust your judgment and follow your lead.
That's my second option.
If you say you can't, I'll do  what I described before.
You have fifteen seconds to decide.
Whether or not you can,
I'll respect your decision.
Eren...
Why would you entrust  me with this choice?
Whenever things get really bad,
you always know the right thing to do.
And I want to rely on you.
When have I...
There have been plenty of times.
Five years ago, if you  hadn't called Hannes,
Titans would have eaten Mikasa and me.
Was it all...
just in my head?
Only I thought that I was useless?  That I was just slowing them down?
These two never thought  that for a second!
Armin, we're out of time!
Looks like the next round is loaded.
We can fire any time.
These two are putting  their lives in my hands.
The two people I trust  most in the world...
What could be more convincing than that?
I will persuade them.
The two of you, avoid doing anything  that'd make them think you're a threat.
Ever since Eren became  a Titan and fought for us,
something has been bothering me.
I don't have it all clear in  my head, but I'll do this!
I'll figure it out while I speak!
Stop!
You've finally shown  your true self, monster!
I'll do it!
I'll give the signal!
He is not an enemy of humanity!
We are prepared to share  all the information we have!
I'm not interested in hearing  you plead for your lives!
How can I believe you, when he's  shown us all what he really is?
If you say he's not an  enemy, then prove it!
If you can't, I'll be forced  to eliminate the threat!
There is no need for proof!
That's right... We don't.
The question isn't what we think of him!
What did you say?
I'm told that many of you saw him!
Then you saw him fighting the Titans!
And you saw the Titans swarm him!
That means the Titans considered him  food, the same way they think of us!
{\i1}That{\i0} is the truth, no matter  what we may think or believe!
He's right...
A Titan as an ally?
That's impossible.
But if we could control a Titan...
Prepare to attack!
Don't be fooled by their clever lies!
The Titans' actions have always  been beyond our understanding!
It's possible they could  pretend to be human,
speak human languages,  and try to deceive us!
We can't let them get  away with anything else!
No...
He isn't even trying to think!
He's scared of thinking!
Eren... Mikasa!
I am a soldier!
I swore long ago to dedicate  my life to the revival of humanity!
If that pursuit were to cost  me my life, I would be glad!
If we use his Titan powers and  the forces we still have,
we could take back this town!
With my final breath before my death,
I shall wish for humanity's glory,
and try to persuade you  of his strategic value!
Captain Wellman, I believe  we should consider—
Shut up!
Their pleas are irrelevant.
They are traitors.
Anyone who violates the  rules must be eliminated.
That is my duty as a soldier!
Enough.
As big as you are, you've always been  as delicate as a newborn fawn.
Commander Pixis!
Do you not see his splendid salute?
I've just arrived, but messengers have  kept me abreast of the situation.
You go command the reinforcements.
I think we should listen to them...
Reports by the Survey Corps had said
the Titans would come from the south.
In fact, it was Zhiganshina District,
south of Wall Maria, that was attacked.
Thus, it was widely believed that  the district south of Wall Rose,
Trost, had the highest likelihood  of being the next target.
{\fad(760,0)}Trost District, Inner Gate
Dot Pixis...
He is the High Commander
of the entire southern region, including Trost.
The man with absolute authority over
the defense of humanity's most important region.
No luck, huh?
I wouldn't mind being eaten by a  really beautiful Titan woman.
And he is known to be a total eccentric.
What is the Commander thinking?
Allowing them up there unguarded,
when we don't know what they are...
I don't know.
The Commander's ideas are always  beyond normal people's comprehension.
Captain...
The squads are in formation.
Oh, excellent.
I see.
And if we reach this basement,  we'll understand everything?
Yes... Will you believe me?
As long as you, yourself,  lack absolute conviction,
I can't promise more than  that I'll keep it in mind.
But I do take pride in being able to  recognize the truth of what I see.
I'll guarantee your safety.
Trainee Arlert, was it?
Yes, sir!
Back there, you said we could use
the Titan's power to reclaim this city.
Did you really think so?
Or was it just a plea to save your life?
Well...
Both.
What I meant was to have
Eren become a Titan,  then move that boulder
to seal the destroyed gate.
But it was just an idea...
I thought I could get them to at least
at least consider using Eren's power  to find a way out of our predicament.
Of course, I wanted to survive!
You wanted to survive.
I can trust those words  more than any others.
Well, Trainee Jaeger?
Yes?
Can you seal that hole?
Well... Well...
I don't know.
I don't know much more than  everyone else here does.
So... whether I can do it or not,
I can't answer you for  sure when I don't know.
That's true.
I'm sorry.
I asked the wrong question.
Will you do it? Or won't you?
I'll do it.
I'll do it!
I don't know whether  I can seal the hole...
But I'll do it!
Although they had fled out of fear,
soldiers choose to stand  once more on the battlefield.
Eren decides to become everyone's hope.
Icon The Battle for Trost (7)
Go, Eren!
In the year 850...
For the first time,
humanity recovered part of its  territory from the Titans.
Though at great cost.
Then I welcome everyone  here to the Survey Corps!
This is a true salute!
Offer up your hearts!
Yes, sir!
You have done well to endure your fear.
You are brave soldiers.
You have my heartfelt respect.
A month later,
led by Erwin Smith, the Survey Corps left Karanes
to find a route to Zhiganshina,
where it's believed the secrets  of the Titans are held.
We will now begin the 57th  expedition beyond the walls!
Onward!
Female Titan  57th Expedition Beyond the Walls (1)
Ahead, to the left, a 10-meter class!
I am very interested in seeing  what's inside its stomach...
But I'll leave it to the support team!
Damn!
Not deep enough.
Defend the formation!
Stay strong!
Leave it to the support team, and keep going!
Onward! Onward!
The support teams will only  accompany us to the old city area.
Once we're past that,  it's completely Titan territory.
The long-range scouting formation devised  by Commander Erwin is our only hope.
We, the special ops squad, are here.
Sir, can they...
Can my classmates beat the Titans?
Huh?
What have you been doing the past month?
Listen, brat...
The most crucial part
of an expedition is in how  you avoid fighting Titans—
Go into long-range scouting formation!
See ya, Armin.
If you run into a Titan, don't piss your pants!
Right!
Same to you, Jean.
Row 3-3: Relay
The vanguard is to spread out in a semi-circle.
But stay within visual range of one another.
Row 5-Center: Standby
Position yourselves at fixed intervals.
Row 2-5: Relay
Extend the recon and message relay  range as far as possible.
Row 3-4: Relay
Row 2-4: Relay
We'll be fine...
Calm down!
It's primarily the forward recon squad  that will encounter Titans.
Row 1-8: Recon
As soon as one is sighted,  they'll fire a red smoke round.
Anyone who sees the flare should fire  the same round to relay the signal.
Row 2-Center: Command
When the Commander sees it,
he'll fire a green smoke round,
and show the formation where to go.
Thus, the entire formation can advance
toward the goal, while avoiding Titans.
Row 2-3: Relay
But sometimes, due to terrain or obstacles,
a Titan won't be sighted until  it's within the formation.
Red... Red...
Red smoke round...
Blause! Over here!
Damn it! Did we let one through?
We'll draw it this way.
Blause, get over here!
I'll handle it!
Split off!
Yes, sir!
Sir...
Back into position!
He ran out of gas.
Something's wrong...
It's been a while since we saw the red smoke round,
but they still haven't reformed.
It can't be...
Note that this strategy only works on normal Titans,
whose behavior can be easily predicted.
A black smoke round?
Is a Titan ignoring the nearby humans
and heading for the formation's center?
It has to be...
That's
an Aberrant!
It's only necessary to fight Aberrants,
whose behavior is unpredictable.
Damn, we'll have to fight it...
Sys, go for the neck!
I'll stop it!
Roger!
Using Maneuver Gear on flat  terrain is a huge disadvantage.
It almost never works.
But I can't let it disrupt the formation.
I think that's Arlert over there.
I don't want one of the  new guys to run into it.
We kill it here!
Now, Sys!
You did it, Squad Leader Ness!
Did I get him?
You came for me?
That's my partner...
I love you, Shallot!
Again?
What is the right flank recon squad doing?
If it ignored them and came this way,
it must be another Aberrant.
Oh, fine...
Sys, we do it again.
Right.
But we've got the worst luck,  doing this twice in a row...
And I think it's at least a fourteen-meter class.
This one will be tough.
What's that?
It's too fast!
Don't let it reach Arlert!
Sys!
Right!
No... No.
That's no Aberrant.
It's intelligent!
Like the Armored or Colossal Titans, or Eren...
A human in the body of a Titan!
B-But who?
Why?
This is bad! What should I do?
I'm going to die, too...
I'll be killed!
Go! Run!
What does it...
No, what do they...
What do they want?
Information We Can Share So Far:
Long-Range Scouting Formation (1)  Devised by Survey Corps Commander  Erwin Smith, its use has dramatically  increased survival rates outside the walls.
Information We Can Share So Far:
Long Range Scouting Formation (2)  Put simply, it's a form of human "radar." By quickly  alerting Erwin in the center to the discovery of  any Titans, the Survey Corps can change course.
Someone tell them...
That the right flank recon squad  has been wiped out...
A Female Titan brought  a huge Titan army!
Is anyone there?
It's not going to kill me?
Why?
It removed my hood...
To... To look at my face?
Armin!
Reiner!
Hey, can you stand?
You won't last outside the walls  unless you're on horseback...
Hurry!
Right!
I saw the smoke round signaling an Aberrant.
Was it that one there with the nice ass?
That's no Aberrant...
It's a human in a Titan body!
What was that?
Wait a second.
We need to fire a smoke round first.
H-Hurry...
There's an emergency over there.
With a smoke round, I'll...
Wait... I think Jean fired it.
It came from the right flank.
Does that mean we're so compromised,  we can't continue the mission?
Looks like the right flank recon  squad was partially wiped out...
Titans, tons of them.
I don't know why,
but there are lots of fast ones.
For now, we're holding them back,
but recon is no longer possible...
We've taken heavy losses,
and if we aren't careful, we'll be destroyed!
That Titan came from the same direction.
No way...
Was it leading the Titans?
It?
Why is a Titan over there?
An Aberrant?
No, it's a human in a Titan body...
Someone with the same ability as Eren.
What?
Why do you think that, Armin?
The Titans only eat us.
We're just killed in the process.
Killing us isn't ever specifically their goal.
But when Sys aimed for its weak spot,
it crushed him and smashed him into the ground.
It killed him to kill, rather than to eat him.
Its nature is different from the others.
When the Colossal and Armored  Titans destroyed the walls,
it must've been the one that  brought that army of Titans.
Their goal has consistently been to attack all humanity!
No, maybe not.
It felt like it was looking for someone...
If that is the case,  could it be looking for...
Could it be looking for Eren?
Eren?
Eren's with Squad Levi, which is  in charge of the right flank.
The right flank?
The plans I got had them  to the rear of the left flank.
Mine said they were near  the front of the right...
Wait, there's no way they'd  be on the front lines.
So where are they?
Probably the safest place in the formation.
Which means in the center,  and toward the rear...
Armin!
There's no time to think.
Smoke rounds can't possibly indicate  how much of a threat it poses!
At this rate, it'll wipe out command.
Then the formation will fall apart,  and that'll be the end.
What are you trying to say?
In other words,
at this range, we may still be  able to draw its attention.
We may be able to buy time to withdraw.
Maybe... Maybe...
But it really is intelligent.
To it, we are nothing but insignificant insects.
It'll just crush us...
Seriously?
That's scary...
Hey, are you really Jean?
The Jean I know never thinks  of anyone but himself.
Don't be an ass...
I just don't want those charred bones I saw
to be disappointed in me!
I...
I know what I have to do now!
And this is the job we chose.
Help me!
Put on your hood.
As far forward as you can...
So that your face is hidden from it.
I don't think it will kill us until  it knows who we are!
Oh...
You believe if it thinks we might  be Eren, it won't kill us?
If nothing else, it'll make me feel better.
Let's just hope it has poor eyesight!
Armin, I thought it was creepy  how you always clung to Eren.
But I've always thought you had it in you.
Uh, thanks.
But "creepy"? That's really mean...
It's going much more slowly  than when I first saw it.
Is it tired?
If it runs at that speed again, we'll be too late!
Now's our chance... We have to do it now!
Listen up... Remember what I said.
Try to draw its attention  for as long as possible,
to give the formation time to withdraw!
Keep it here as long as you can.
If we could cut its Achilles tendon,  that'd be more than enough.
But don't do anything stupid...
Don't try to kill it!
It's aware of the weak spot on its neck.
It's totally different than other Titans...
It is impossible to kill.
At least, not by any normal human being.
However...
If it's those two... Maybe...
Armin!
This one...
Its movements are much more  precise than the others' are!
Damn it.
I...
I underestimated it!
It protected its neck...
Jean!
Damn it! I can't get away!
I'm going to die!
Once it grasps my wire, it's over!
Jean!
Avenge the suicidal bastard!
Armin?
It stopped?
That's the one...
That's the one that killed him!
He rushed to his death on the right flank!
Avenge him!
What happened?
Did Armin hit his head and go insane?
This isn't the time...
R-Reiner?
It crushed my best friend!
I saw his body under its foot!
He's going straight for the neck?
No, it's working!
While it's distracted by Armin!
H-Hey...
H-Hey... Reiner, you...
Reiner did it!
Mikasa was so strong, I forgot.
But he's really strong and reliable, too...
We've bought enough time, right?
Let's get the hell away from it!
If it isn't a man-eater, it won't follow us!
Look...
That big bitch got scared  and decided to go home!
No... Why?
That's toward the center rear.
Is it
heading toward Eren?
"You monster..."
Even highly trained members of the Survey Corps
are unable to stop the Female Titan.
The monster finally catches sight  of Eren in a forest of giant trees.
Forest of Giant Trees  57th Expedition Beyond the Walls(2)
Armin, I'm glad I could be  a good person to you.
You've won your bet.
But...
This is where {\i1}my{\i0} bet begins!
We have identified a person of interest  who may be the Female Titan.
Her name is...
Annie...
Mercy  Raid on Stohess District (2)
{\fad(452,1)}Several Days Earlier
They're late...
Erwin and his men are keeping me waiting.
The MP escorts will come here before they do.
He's probably constipated  and having a rough day.
You're talking a lot today, Captain.
Don't be stupid.
I always talk a lot.
I'm sorry.
Back then, if I hadn't made the wrong choice...
This never would've happened.
I told you...
No one ever knows how things will turn out.
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Not at all, sir.
You guys!
U-Um...
We have identified a person of interest  who may be the Female Titan.
This time, we won't let her escape.
The operation will be in two days.
It will take place in Stohess District,  on our way to the capital.
This is our first and last chance.
Once we pass that point, Eren will  be remanded to the capital.
Our pursuit of those who seek to destroy the walls  will become fraught with difficulty.
Ultimately, humanity stands to go extinct.
We will stake everything on this plan.
Here it is.
When we pass through Stohess,  Eren will act as a decoy,
and lead the target into  this underground tunnel.
If we can get her to the lowest level,
given the tunnel's size and structural integrity,
even if the target transforms,  we can immobilize her.
But if she transforms before then...
Eren, we'll need your help.
Yes, sir.
As for the target...
Are we sure she is in Stohess?
Yes, our target is a member  of the Military Police.
The Military Police?
It was Armin who arrived at that conclusion.
He believes the target also  killed the two captured Titans.
She may be a former trainee from  the 104th, the same as you.
W-Wait a second... The 104th?
The name of the girl we believe to  be the person of interest is...
Hey, wait...
Annie Leonhart.
C-Crap...
Damn it... That ring!
She knew I was bluffing from the start.
She knew we would ambush her.
We must have had another way!
Save it for later.
What do we need to do right now?
For now, let's meet up with  Squad 3 and get above ground.
We'll follow plan B.
We fight Annie... The Female Titan!
Eren transforms as planned,  and assists in her capture!
You'll do it, right?
Yeah!
Hey!
There's Squad 3!
Did the first capture attempt fail?
It did!
Switch to plan B!
She stomped right through the ground?!
We have to help them!
Eren...
Get back!
Hey, Mikasa...
The Female Titan's willing to let Eren die?
She made a bet...
When she created that hole,  she bet that Eren wouldn't die.
It's crazy, but it also means  she'll be tough to beat!
To take Eren, Annie's willing  to assume any risk!
What should we do?
Our exit is gone.
Even if we use our 3D Maneuver  Gear to make a quick exit,
she'll be right there waiting for us.
But if we...
If we stay here, who knows when she'll crush us?
I'll do something!
Like when I blocked that cannon shell...
Come this way!
Wait!
Let's go...
Stay close!
Not again!
No...
Now, of all times...
It hurts!
You can't transform without  a specific goal, right?
Picture it in your mind again... Clearly!
I am!
But...
Don't tell me...
You still have reservations about fighting Annie.
Eren?
After everything you've seen,
do you still think it might be all a mistake  that Annie is the Female Titan?
What did you just see?
She's the one who killed our fellow soldiers.
How can you still think that?
Shut up!
I'm trying, aren't I?!
Annie's the Female Titan?
Why?
Why do you think that, Armin?
From the start, the Female Titan  knew what you looked like.
And she reacted to your  nickname, "suicidal bastard,"
which only the 104th trainees would know.
And the biggest reason
is that I believe Annie killed the  test subjects, Sawney and Bean.
How can you tell?
Only someone very skilled could have done it.
And they'd have used their own Maneuver  Gear, which they're accustomed to.
Yeah, wasn't that why they  inspected our Maneuver Gear?
But they didn't find anything on Annie...
Annie brought Marco's Maneuver  Gear to the inspection.
That's why she managed  to avoid getting caught.
Huh?
What are you talking about?
What does Marco have to do with this?
I don't know.
Are you sure it was his?
Yes, I know what I—
Hey, kid.
We get it.
Do you have any other evidence?
No, I don't.
I think Annie's face resembles the Female Titan's.
Huh?
What are you talking about?!
That isn't evidence—
So, you have no proof,  but you'll do it anyway.
You have no proof?
What?
Then why do it?
What if it isn't her?
Then we'll know she's innocent. That's all.
And then I'll feel bad for Annie.
However, if we don't do something,
you'll end up being sacrificed  to the people in the capital!
You're crazy to think Annie's a Titan.
Eren, now that you know we suspect her,
isn't it ringing any bells?
You fought the Female Titan.
Didn't anything remind you of  Annie's distinctive combat style?
You do know, don't you?
You know Annie is the Female Titan.
Then we should fight her, shouldn't we?
Or do you have certain feelings  for her? Is that what's stopping you?
Huh?
I have a plan!
Mikasa and I will exit at the same time,  using the original entrance and that opening.
Annie will attack one of us.
Use that opportunity to get  out from the other exit!
Wait!
Then one of you will die!
If we stay here, we all die, anyway!
Mikasa, take your position!
Right.
I'll take the front.
Mikasa!
Armin!
How?
How can you fight her?
How?!
We don't have a choice.
The world is cruel.

Eren!
Annie, I won't let you have Eren!
Eren!
Eren...
I'll get you out!
Open your eyes...
Don't let the Female Titan escape!
Don't let her get out!
What happened?
Escort team, we don't need you here!
Go see what's happening!
Roger!
Something's off...
That explosion I heard...
Nile...
Deploy all of your troops.
We should assume a Titan has appeared.
Wh-What?!
This is Wall Sina...
There's no way a Titan could be here!
Wait! Don't move, Jaeger!
I'm done with this disguise!
Never call me by that name again, moron!
Commander, I'm going, too.
Get your equipment from Squad 4.
Roger!
It's good to see that someone  has the balls to go,
but don't forget to do your  damnedest to stay alive.
Yes, sir.
Erwin, what is this?
Commander, here!
Good work.
Hey, Erwin!
Anyone who can move, follow me!
We'll rendezvous with the capture teams.
Erwin, wait.
What you're doing is clearly  treason against the crown!
Nile, I'm starting to wonder if your brains don't  even live up to that sorry excuse of a beard.
Seems to me that you don't even  have a clue what's going on.
Remove your equipment, Erwin!
A Titan! A Titan's here!
What's it doing here?
Run!
Hey, isn't that a Titan?
Yeah... But how?
Out of the way!
Damn those slackers!
I could've been one of them.
What the hell happened?
Damn it!
Don't attempt to kill it.
Just try to slow it down!
It's no use... It knows how  Maneuver Gear works!
I'm not going to make  this easy on you!
Eren!
Answer me! Eren!
Hey! What are you doing?
Jean!
Eren's trapped!
The plan was for him to become a Titan!
He couldn't...
I think the fact that it's Annie is stopping him.
Annie?
Anyway, we have to save him!
Jean, help me!
He couldn't transform?
Eren, what the hell is wrong with you?!
Didn't I once tell you that  I'm counting on you?
We have to entrust the world,  humanity, and our lives to you,
and this is how you repay us?
Marco... Marco...
Damn it!
Eren...
It's no use...
We have to do something about her first!
Eren, I said this once to Jean...
Someone who can't sacrifice anything  can never change anything...
That to defeat monsters, you have to be
willing to throw aside your humanity.
Annie is certainly capable of doing that...
although I don't know what her reasons are.
But whoever can do it will win!
Annie!
If you can't kill me this time,
you can't make the same bullshit excuse  that your bet's just beginning anymore!
Armin, this way!
Roger!
It's coming...
It's coming.
Squad Leader...
You have a crazy look in your eyes.
Okay!
I thought there'd be no need  for a plan C, but nope...
That's Commander Erwin for you, I guess.
Now, then...
Be a good girl.
Stay put.
Here, you're too far in to get Titans  to devour you like before.
But don't worry...
I'll be the one devouring you instead.
I'll devour all the information  that we can drag out of you.
She broke free?
We needed more traps!
Don't let her escape! Follow her!
Someone who can't sacrifice anything
can never change anything!
I know that...
That's why I failed.
I clung to my companions and  my ties to them, and I failed.
Remember...
I'll wipe you out...
No...
I'll kill you!
There's no time to figure out  if this is the right thing to do!
Just move...
Don't try to keep your hands clean!
That's right...
Mikasa!
The world is cruel!
Now what?
Eren!
Eren...
"I will eradicate Titans from this world."
The same fury that led Eren to make  that vow on that fateful day
now spurs him on...
to destroy the entire world.
The Wall   Raid on Stohess District (3)
We don't have a choice.
The world is cruel.
I'll wipe you out...
No...
I'll kill you!
That day, humanity remembered...
the terror of being ruled by them.
The humiliation of being kept in a cage.
Eren!
Eren...
The Wall  Raid on Stohess District (3)
Let us pray for the well-being  of the three goddesses,
Maria, Rose, Sina.
For our continued peace and safety...
You must not doubt the holy walls!
The walls of light, born of god's hand,
will become stronger through  our devotion and faith.
An innocent heart, believing in god,
is our only protection from the Titans!
Our only way to keep them at bay—
A Titan?
What's it doing here?
No...
Stay away from the walls...
Not the walls!
This time, it seems he's retaining control.
Yes.
But Eren's never managed  to beat the Female Titan.
Now that he's a Titan,  he must be prepared to fight...
He won't go down so easily—
Willpower alone isn't enough in battle.
You know that, Jean!
Defeating Annie will require far more...
An open area!
The Female Titan's heading for an open area!
We can't use Maneuver Gear there!
Split up and work your way  around to the other side!
Roger!
Hurry, hurry, hurry!
This doesn't make sense...
What's a Titan doing here?
Annie...
You always acted like you found  everything incredibly stupid.
{\fad(1,446)}You always seemed bored.
But there were times  when you looked alive...
When you were showing off your martial arts.
You said none of it mattered, but...
To me, it didn't look like  you really believed that.
I just thought you were a terrible liar...
Tell me, Annie...
What are you fighting for?
What could have been worth  killing all those people?!
What is this?
Squad Leader,
even if we can capture the Female Titan,
they might destroy the whole city first!
We do it, regardless.
That was Erwin's decision.
Be ready to capture her.
Yes, sir.
Eren...
No one told me anything about this...
Why are Titans fighting here?
What's going on?
Titans fighting each other?
Yes...
The damage to the city is unbelievable!
There are many casualties,  both civilian and military.
Erwin! Is all this due to your plan?!
That's correct.
All of this was my personal decision.
I don't intend to make excuses.
You must have known what would happen
if you executed a plan like this in the city.
How? How could you do this?
To lead
humanity to victory.
Bullshit!
You're a traitor!
I could execute you right here and now,  and none of the brass would even care!
That's fine by me.
But then you must assume command.
You must not let the Female Titan escape.
Paehl's in charge of formation.
Vyler oversees supply.
Work with them to drive her  to the east wall at all costs.
{\a6}W-Wait... Wait!
Are you...
Are you really telling me
that this will help humanity?
I believe it is a step forward.
Lower your guns, all of you.
Handcuff him!
Yes, sir.
Deploy all of our men.
Your priority is civilian  rescue and evacuation!
Yes, sir!
Erwin, a trial will decide your punishment.
Once this is over, I'll submit to one with pleasure.
Levi, you stay put.
You dislike pointless deaths.
Yeah, you're right.
I despise it, whether it be mine or my  causing someone else's.
Someone who can't sacrifice anything
can never change anything!
In order to overcome a monster,  you must be willing
to throw aside your humanity.
Annie is certainly capable of doing that...
Annie...
Annie!
Annie...
Your dad is the only one on your side.
I'll...
kill the Titans...
Every last one of them!
Eren!
That's...
Eren!
Don't!
Right now, we don't know if  Eren can recognize you...
H-Hey...
Hey!
The wall!
Does she intend to climb over it?!
No...
She's going to get away!
I won't let that happen!
Annie...
Fall.
Annie...
I was wrong.
It's too late to ask your forgiveness.
But...
There's one thing...
I want to ask of you.
You can make the whole world your enemy...
I'll destroy the entire world!
Even if the whole world hates you,
your dad is the one person who is on your side!
Crap... He'll eat the girl inside, too!
Don't, Eren!
Eren!
I am free...
So promise me...
That you will return...
What happened?
What?
They're fusing?!
Eren!
Don't eat a valuable witness, you idiot.
What We Can Share So Far: The Walls (1) - The year 784... One blistering hot night, a miner decided to dig under Wall Sina, to live within the inner ring. "Life in Wall Sina would be pretty nice." That thought had come to him suddenly a few days ago, as he dug with his shovel, deep in a coal mine. In a way, you could call it divine inspiration. And so, for the next few days, he wandered along the wall, finally settling on a spot where the dense forest pressed against it. No one would chance upon him, and the overhead leaves would shelter him and his task from the prying eyes of the guards above. On the next night, he began. Using his trusty shovel, the miner began to dig. The work went smoothly, and before long, the pit was as deep as he was tall. When he could no longer fling the dirt outside it, he stuffed it into sacks, climbing a ladder to discard it. Completely dedicated to the task at hand, he took only a few short breaks to drink water and to ease his weary muscles. After spending twenty years of his life digging without a day of rest, the miner knew he was an expert at it. And during that time, he'd learned to dig deeper, more quickly, and more efficiently than anyone else. Tunnels that would stump any other miner were no match for his shovel. But that day was different. He dug for hours, yet never seemed to get anywhere. As he dug, he probed to either side of the main pit with his shovel, but it was of no use. The wall's foundation seemed to go down forever, deep into the earth, blocking his path at every turn. Still, he persevered. Any thought of digging his way to an easy life inside Wall Sina had been long forgotten. He simply wanted to conquer the wall. "I'm willing to bet all the years I've spent digging that I will beat this wall," he said to himself, wiping the sweat from his brow. The hole was more than four or five times the miner's height when he struck hard rock. He wondered, "Bedrock?" But it appeared to be of the same material as the wall's foundation itself. The miner swung his shovel down hard on the rock. The shovel shattered, but the rock was unscathed. The miner sighed, and his sigh was deeper than any hole he'd dug in the previous twenty years.
What We Can Share So Far: The Walls (2) - With a frown, his friend questioned, "The Wall?" "It's weird, isn't it?" the miner said, lifting his drink to his lips. "Who knew that the wall went so deep underground?" The pair sat across from one another at a table in the back of a tavern in a seedy part of town. Most days, the miner would go there with his friend, his only friend, after work. That day, the day after he'd tried to dig under the wall, they'd gone there as usual, once the workday was done. And then, the miner told his friend the story, certain that his friend could keep a secret. "Maybe we're surrounded by walls not only above the ground, but below the ground, too," said the miner. "Tell me something... What, exactly, are the walls?" His friend cut him off with a cough, glancing around the tavern. The patrons were all busy drinking, hitting on the tavern maid, or yelling at one another. No one was watching them. But even so, the miner decided not to say another word about it. If anyone heard him, the Military Police would be there in an instant. "Does it really matter?" his friend asked. "Just keep on living here as you always have. You're poor, but you have a job every day, and enough money that you can drink. Isn't that enough?" "Yeah," the miner replied. "Yeah, it is. I'll go back to digging. In the end, I guess that's my lot in life." But the next day, the miner didn't show up for work. Nor the next... Nor the day after that. His friend went to his house many times, but never saw any sign of him. The miner had no relatives, nor other close friends, so there was no one to ask where he might have gone. Unsure what to do, his friend eventually went to the Garrison, and told them the whole story. The next day, the Military Police and the Garrison organized a large-scale search party. It was a little excessive for one poor miner, even if that miner was a criminal who'd tried to pass under the walls. His friend couldn't understand why they were so bent on finding him. But they never found a trace of the miner, nor even the pit he'd dug. And one day, his friend also vanished, never to be seen again.
Eren...
Mikasa?
Where's Annie?
Damn it...
What is this?!
We've come this far, and you  still won't say a word, Annie?!
Come out!
Come out and finish what you started!
Hey, this isn't fair... Annie! Annie!
Stop it.
It's useless.
Use the wires to make a net!
We'll tie it up and carry it underground.
Yes, sir.
If we can't get any information from Annie,  what do we have to show for all this?
We have caused so many deaths.
And yet, despite all those lives lost,  so many mysteries remain.
What did we accomplish?
I don't suppose we can call  this operation a success...
No.
We have ensured the continued  survival of the Survey Corps,
most likely by the skin of our teeth.
I hope so.
Erwin...
I have several questions  about this plan of yours.
If you had a suspect,
why did you not ask the Military Police for help?
Governor, that's because...
With the Female Titan potentially having allies,
I needed to limit the operation to  those I was certain were uninvolved.
But what about the damage to Stohess from this?
Our best efforts were not enough.
You have our sincere apologies.
Do you think apologies are enough?!
Had we left her alone,
the walls would have been destroyed,  and far more would have died.
I see.
And after all the deaths this operation has caused,
do you have conclusive proof that it  has forestalled humanity's extinction?
I can't imagine we'll be able to get anything
from Annie Leonhart now.
No, I doubt it would be possible.
In other words... This was all for nothing?
Eren...
Are you doing okay?
Yeah...
I've healed so fast, it's almost creepy.
I heard that Annie's still frozen.
Yeah.
Damn it!
We got nothing from that  massive operation!
She was willing to go that far  to protect the information.
Yeah, she got away from us.
Eren's the one who allowed it.
Right, Eren?
Without that one instant...
Yeah,
you're right.
I couldn't do it.
When I saw Annie, I froze.
Armin Arlert...
Jean Kirschstein.
It's time for your questioning.
Yes, sir.
They're starting with us?
Okay, see you later.
Yeah.
It felt good at the time, you know...
It even felt good to get all beat up.
I thought I wouldn't even mind dying.
Eren!
That isn't how I feel now.
I'm glad that you
came back.
It's impossible for me to understand.
Abandon your humanity to overcome a monster.
That's the only way to win?
It's one possible way that humanity  might defeat the Titans.
I think Eren can do it.
Tell me...
Even if he did become that monster,  and destroyed all the Titans...
Would that really be a victory for humanity?
Eat.
It won't be easy to overcome...
But I believe we have gained  a tremendous opportunity
to ensure the survival of humanity.
Compared to when we never even imagined  that humans could transform into Titans,
the very fact that we've captured one of  the enemy is a massive step forward.
Yes, they are out there.
And we'll track them all down.
All the Titans within the walls.
Now it is our turn to attack!
The summons for Eren Jaeger and the  Survey Corps were suspended indefinitely.
The custody of Annie Leonhart was  granted to the Survey Corps,
who kept her deep underground.
However,
it would still take
much sacrifice and time  before humanity learned
what it was that held them captive...
