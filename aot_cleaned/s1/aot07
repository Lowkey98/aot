Over a hundred years ago,
humanity suddenly found itself  faced with a new predator.
They were far more powerful than humans.
Humanity was immediately pushed  to the brink of extinction.
The survivors built three walls:
Maria, Rose, and Sina.
There, they enjoyed a century of peace.
However...
In the year 845...
the Colossal and Armored Titans,
suddenly appeared, destroying the wall,
along with the life we'd known.
Humanity abandoned Wall Maria,
losing twenty percent of its population  and a third of its territory,
to retreat within Wall Rose.
In the year 850...
The Colossal Titan reappeared and breached the wall,
allowing the Titans to invade yet again.
Eren! Hurry!
Two hours later, the population had  been successfully evacuated.
No one was lost to the Titans.
No one except the soldiers
who had gone to intercept them.
Eren...
As long as I have you,
I can do anything.
The Small Blade  The Battle for Trost (3)
Wait, Captain!
If the Titans attack,
we supply troops won't be able  to protect this place alone.
Please! Stay here!
Out of the way.
I must organize the reinforcement squads.
Within the inner gate, where it's safe?
What are you trying to say?
This is our procedure!
It is our duty as soldiers  to follow procedure!
B-But if this place falls—
Silence!
Another word, and I'll be forced
to deem you traitors  and punish you right here!
I heard the bell sound a temporary retreat.
Why does no one try to climb the walls?
It's over...
It's all over.
Got it.
What good will that do?
Hey, Jean! What should we do?
There's nothing we can do...
They finally issued the order to retreat,
but without more gas, we can't climb the walls.
So we're all going to die...
Because of those cowards.
The supply team...
What happened to them?!
Were they wiped out?
They're too terrified to move.
I can see why...
But abandoning their mission to resupply us,  to hide inside HQ? Unbelievable.
And sure enough,
the Titans have swarmed them,  so we can't go get more gas...
Then we must take a chance,
and try to destroy the Titans around HQ!
We won't be any worse off than sitting here...
The Titans will be here before long!
And if we keep running,  we'll just waste the gas we have.
Without use of our Maneuver Gear,  we really are done for!
I'm surprised to see you using  your head for once, Connie.
But do you think we can do that,  given our numbers here?
Most of the veterans in the  vanguard were killed.
Which of us trainees could lead  a suicide mission like that?
Well, even if someone could,  we can't fight the Titans.
I bet the gas supply room  is chock full of 3- to 4-meter class Titans.
Obviously, we can't refuel with them around.
So we're doomed?
What a stupid life...
If I'd known this would happen,  I would've told them.
Let's do it, guys!
Come on, stand up...
If we all work together, we'll be fine!
I'll take the lead.
Armin, let's all...
Reiner,
what should we do?
Nothing yet.
If we do it, we do it all together.
It's hopeless...
There's no way any of us can  make it out of this town alive.
I knew I could die...
But what am I dying for?
Mikasa?
I thought you were with the rearguard.
Annie!
I have a basic idea of what's happening.
And I'm sorry to involve my personal feelings,
but did you see Eren's team?
I didn't see them,
but no one's made it up the walls.
Actually, Armin's over there.
Armin!
Mikasa!
No!
How am I supposed to face her?
I survived for nothing.
I wish I'd died back there with him!
Armin, are you hurt?
Are you okay?
Where is Eren?
Armin?
The members of Trainee Corps team 34...
Thomas Wagner, Nack Tias,
Milius Zermusky, Mina Karolina...
Eren Jaeger!
These five died valiantly in the line of duty!
No...
Team 34 was almost wiped out, then?
If we try to face the Titans,  the same will happen to us.
I'm sorry, Mikasa...
Eren... He sacrificed himself for me.
I...
I couldn't do anything!
I'm sorry...
Armin.
Calm down.
This isn't the time to get emotional.
Eh?
Now, stand up.
Marco, if we eliminate the Titans swarming HQ,
then we can refuel and climb the walls.
Isn't that right?
That's right, but...
But even with you here, there are too many...
I can do it.
Huh?
I am strong!
Stronger than you guys.
Very strong.
Therefore, I can defeat those Titans!
Even on my own.
You are not only weak,
but you are spineless cowards.
I am disappointed in you.
Just stay here...
Stay here and watch.
Hey, Mikasa! What are you saying?!
You're going to fight all  those Titans by yourself?!
There's no way you can do that!
If I can't, I'll die.
But if I win, I'll live.
If I don't fight, I can't win.
Wait!
What's disappointing here is your vocabulary...
Was that supposed to be  an inspirational speech?
This is your fault, Eren!
Listen up!
Were we trained to let our  fellow soldiers fight alone?!
Do you really want to become cowards?!
I wouldn't want that.
Come on, coward...
Wimp...
Idiot!
Those guys...
Damn it... I'll do it!
Hurry!
Follow Mikasa!
We do this fast.
We need to storm HQ  before our gas runs out!
Mikasa's amazing, though...
How does she move so fast?
No, she's using too much gas!
She'll run out fast!
No matter how good you are,
without the Maneuver Gear, you're helpless!
I knew she wasn't her usual calm self.
She's trying to ignore  her shock by taking action!
At this rate, she'll...
Mikasa!
Damn it!
Jean, you take over.
I'll go after Armin!
I will, too.
What are you doing?
The Titans are still out there!
We need your skills!
Again...
This, again.
I lost my family once more...
Do I have to remember the pain again,
and start over again from here?

Information We Can Share So Far:

It's hopeless...
We can't even get close to HQ.
Not unless we're willing to risk casualties.
Damn! He's out of gas!
Stay back!
Tom, I'm coming for you!
Don't...
It's too late!
Don't—
Why couldn't I stop them?
Why didn't I stop them?
If I had forced them to stop,
this wouldn't have happened...
Do I have the right
to hold a position of responsibility?
No!
Please, no!
No!
I don't want to die!
This world is cruel.
And also
very beautiful.
It was a good life.
What?
Why?
I thought I'd given up.
Why do I keep standing up?
Why am I struggling?
To what end?
There's no point
in living anymore.
What is driving me?
Fight!
{\fad(1,315)}Fight... Fight!
Eren.
Fight...
Fight!
Fight...
Fight!
I'm sorry, Eren.
I won't give up anymore.
I'll never give up again.
Once I'm dead,
I won't even be able to remember you.
So I'll win, no matter what.
I'll live, no matter what!
What happened?
A Titan
killing
another Titan?
Please, Mikasa... Be safe!
Mikasa!
Mikasa, are you hurt?
Are you two okay?
Yeah!
We need to move!
Oh, no! Two 15-meter class Titans!
No, that Titan...
H-He finished it off?
He knew where to hit it, to kill it?
We've gotta move
before it comes after us!
No. It's showing no interest in us...
Even though it should've attacked us by now.
It appeared to know  rudimentary combat skills, too.
What is it?
We just have to assume it's another Aberrant!
We know barely anything about them...
Anyway, let's get to HQ.
Wait!
Mikasa's out of gas.
Huh?!
Hey, seriously?
What are we supposed to do without you?
There's only one thing to do...
I don't have much left, either.
But we need to exchange the canisters, now!
Armin!
There's no other choice!
There's no point in my having them.
But...
Don't waste it this time.
Use it to save everyone.
I led everyone into battle without  being willing to protect them.
And for a minute, I gave up on living,
not feeling responsible  for them in the least.
And all for personal reasons...
I...
Okay, the starter device still works.
I gave you all my blades.
But please let me keep this one.
I don't want to be eaten alive.
N-No...
Armin...
I won't leave you here.
At the time,
I was filled with confusion.
I'd never heard of a Titan  killing another Titan.
I also felt a glimmer of exhilaration.
I felt
the rage of humanity itself  was embodied in what I saw.
A Titan that slays other Titans.
The 104th Trainee Corps members are shocked  into stunned silence by the spectacle.
And soon, they see...
