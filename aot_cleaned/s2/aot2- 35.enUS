It's like the report said...
The entire village is devastated,
and yet there's not a drop of blood,\Nlet alone any bodies here.
Then... the villagers of Ragako\Nwere able to safely evacuate?
If that's the case,
then the Titans were having\Na field day in a completely empty village.
That's hard to believe.
Furthermore... why would they evacuate\Nwithout even taking a single horse?
Then what happened?
What could this mean?
Moblit, I found one! This way!
There you are...
Moblit, look at this.
This is a portrait of \NConny Springer's parents?
It's a strong possibility.
Kill it!
Wait! Hold up!
Unbelievable...
"Children"
Will it be your petty life...\Nor Christa's future?
It's up to you to decide.
Hey, say something! Who's the enemy?!
Ymir!
Who knows...
It's settled then.
Too bad, Eren.
You're kidding...
The Scouts... are already...
Dammit!
Reiner. What are you right now?
Relax, I'm a warrior.
You're saying to trust Ymir as a warrior?
Isn't she the one who ate Marcel?
Yeah, that's my point. \NYmir's motive is clear.
Once she turned human again,
she probably roamed around\Nand lived only caring about herself.
Until she met Christa...
And as cute as Christa is, we have\Nother reasons to bring her to our side.
She's an important person\Nin a family of the Church.
If Eren turns out not to be the Coordinate,\Nour job isn't over yet.
Having Christa with us at that point\Nwill make our search much easier.
They're close.
What are they talking about?
Are they planning to leave \Nbefore the sun sets?
Let's bring an end to it.
The next time we come here,
we can take Annie, Christa, \Nand that back home.
That way we won't have to come here anymore.
Right. And our mission will be over.
But as for you...
When we get to our hometown,\Ntell Annie how you feel.
Huh? Wh-What do you mean?
You stare too much.
Enough that everyone can tell.
But I--
You should go for it.
You're both murderers with short lives ahead.
Who better to understand what\Nwe've gone through than one of us?
What's going on, Reiner?
Aren't we waiting until night?
Nope. We're leaving now.
Eren, don't try to resist.
Come on, don't get violent with me.
Look at the shape that I'm in.\NDoes it look like I can resist?
Please, gimme a break.
Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die!
I'll kill you! I'll slaughter you!
--I'll kill you!\N--Hey. Why are we leaving already?
--Let go!\N--Ymir.
When you turned back into a human,\Ndo you remember the person you ate?
No, I don't remember...
But if it was five years ago...
Was it one of your comrades?
I see...
Sorry... for not even remembering.
It's not your fault for forgetting.
It was the same for us, too.
I see...
Eren doesn't seem to remember either.
Is that how it works?
Do you resent me for it?
I'm not sure... I... don't know.
You probably didn't want\Nto eat a human either...
How long were you wandering\Noutside the walls for?
About 60 years.
It was like... I was stuck in\Na nightmare that would never  end.
A red smoke signal.
What?
Commander! We're surrounded!
There's a way around!\NShould we head towards it?
No... Any detours and we'll be too late.
We'll force our way through!\NAll soldiers, prepare for battle!
For now, let's get to a place without Titans!
We need to get as far away as possible!
My Titan form isn't very fast.
If I get surrounded,\NI won't be able to protect you guys!
Then why didn't we just \Nwait until nightfall?!
Smoke signals?\NDid the Scouts come to rescue us?
Unless they brought loads \Nof horses over the wall,
that scouting formation won't work.
Someone made that call...
I didn't think it would happen so soon.
It must be Commander Erwin.\NA tough opponent!
Shit... They're already that close?
It's Eren's fault for going berserk.
It can't be...
She's...
No, she is!
Reiner! Christa's here!\NChrista came with them!
Huh?!
If you want her, now's the chance!
How do you know? You can't see her from here!
I just know it!
She's such a good-natured \Nperson, it's stupid!
I guarantee she came to save me! I know it!
Even if that's true, it's no use!
We'll do it later!
Huh?!
Our chance of succeeding is way too low!
How will you get Christa \Nout of that formation?
Wait for a chance!
Wait for a chance?
Seriously? Will that be after\NI'm eaten by one of your warriors?
No! I don't trust you!
Trust me! Christa is \Nindispensable to us, too!
Then get her now!\NGo prove it to me this instant!
It has to be now or never!
I want to see her right now!
At this rate...\NI'll never get a chance...
to see her again.
"Information Available for Public Disclosure"\N"Ymir's Hometown"
{\a2}"It is not known where Ymir's hometown is located.\N However, its location is most certainly\N outside the confines of the walls."
It's impossible.
I'm sorry, Ymir.
We don't even know if we can escape \Nourselves, let alone go back for her.
I promise you!
If anyone, it's Christa I want\Nto save from this conflict!
You have to trust us! So just bear with it!
This is for Christa's \Nown sake! Got it, Ymir?!
Is it... really for Christa's sake?
Yeah!
Fine...
Thank you.
It's happening again, Christa...
I've come this far...
...and yet it seems...
Will I have to lie to myself again?
Hey... Here's a promising one.
How's this kid?
Yeah.
Hey, you there. You're going to\Ncome live with us from now on.
You'll be able to live a brand-new life now.
A brand-new life... needs a brand-new name.
Understand?
That day... was the first \Ntime I lied to myself.
From that point on, I convinced myself...\Nthat I never had a choice.
But...
It is this Lady Ymir who inherits\Nthe blood of the king.
As long as Lady Ymir is with us,\Nwe will be blessed with immortality.
Lady Ymir!
To be honest... it wasn't all that bad.
My food wasn't cold anymore...
And neither was my bed off the ground.
Lady Ymir.
But more than all... was the feeling\Nof being needed by someone.
I served a purpose in someone's life\Nfor the first time ever.
To me, that was more precious\Nthan anything else.
But then, one day...
It's her! She's the one who did it!
She told us she has the blood of the king!\NAll we did was believe her!
I was cruelly reminded\Nthat everything in my life...
...was a lie.
Is that right?
N-N--
It's true.
I am Ymir! The blood of the king\Nruns through me!
And once again... I told more lies.
If that's what it took \Nto save everyone else...
However...
Things didn't work that way.
No!
Stop... Please, stop! I'm begging you!
That's when I knew...
This was my punishment.
It's not that I was being punished\Nfor deceiving all those people.
It was for convincing myself to believe...\Nto feel needed by someone.
It's what I deserved for\Ncontinuing to lie to myself.
This was my punishment.
It's a Titan! Run!
When I opened my eyes...
...what I saw was freedom \Nspread out before me.
If there was such a thing as fate,\NI can only laugh at how fickle it can be.
And in that moment...
...I made a promise to myself.
I was done with telling lies.
I wasn't going to lie to myself anymore.
From then on, I'd live honest to myself.
So? What ever happened with that?
She was given the name Christa Lenz\Nand sent off to become a cadet.
What a pity. She would have been\Nbetter off not being born.
Are you talking about me?!
Come on, now. It makes no difference to me.
And then...
Hey, you.
So you're trying to do something "nice," huh?
Uh...
And then I met you.
I could tell right away...\N...that you were the same as me...
That you fed yourself lies...
Give your hearts!
Yes, Sir!
That you were someone desperately trying\Nto convince yourself...
But you know, Christa...
That's why... I won't ask you to understand.
Just that...
...that you give me one last time...
...to be honest with myself.
I'm sorry...
In this environment, I'm \Nthe strongest one here.
Q-Quit it, Ymir!
Don't you think a forest like this\Nis where I can shine the most? Well?
Ymir! Stop! We'll fall!
Do you think I care?
If I became a Titan, I might be\Npowerless compared to you,
but I can jump through the \Ntrees and move swiftly.
I could snatch Eren away from you\Nand go back to meet up with the Scouts...
...and probably succeed.
If you don't agree to take\NChrista with you right now,
I'll get in your way and \Nfight you right here.
Wh-What are you saying?!\NDon't you care what happens to her?!
We can't help her that way!
Yeah, that's fine.
Even if it means taking her future away,\NI'll do what it takes to live and meet her.
I might be the shittiest \Nperson there ever was.
You guys don't know what it's like.
She knows how awful I am,\Nand yet she still smiles at me... that girl.
You...
Don't be mad at me.
I have a plan for it.
If I stay and fight, it should be easier\Nfor you to escape anyways!
Or would you rather stay \Nand kill each other?!
Do you want me to prove how crazy I am?!
A light?
Straight ahead in the forest! I saw a light!
It's the light that appears\Nwhen a Titan transforms!
Then we're just in time.
Soldiers, disperse!
We believe the enemy has already transformed!
Locate Eren and recover him!
Another one of the Police!
Battle is not our objective!
Prioritize recovery and retreat!
Phil! Round up the horses!
Yes, Sir!
First thing is to find the enemy\Nand let the others know!
They should be fleeing from the forest!
Break!
Eren.
Where are you?!
Is that the scream of a Titan?
It came from ahead!
You can't hide from me!
Wait!
This is Ymir!
She's the one they took! In Titan form!
Hey, Ymir! Why are you the only one here?!
Where's Eren?!\NWhat about Reiner!? Bertholdt?!
So that's Ymir?
Did she turn into a Titan\Nand fight with Reiner?!
Ymir?
Did you get away from Reiner?!\NWhere are they?!
Tell us anything, Ymir!
Say something already!
Hey, ugly! We're in a hurry!
Is she keeping an eye out for Reiner?
Something's not right.
Why... is she looking \Nat everybody one by one?
Ymir!
Thank goodness!
You're all right!
Huh?
No...
She...
She ate Christa!
Don't just stand there! Chase her!
She's fast! We're losing her!
Why would Ymir do that?!
I can't be the only one who could've \Nguessed it would turn out this way!
Yeah! She's clearly hostile to us now!
Looks like she's cooperating with Reiner!\NShe lured us right in!
Here she comes, Reiner.
Right.
Oh no...
Eren's being taken away!
Don't stop!
Get on your horse and chase!
I'm getting him back no matter what!
Even if it means trading my life for it!
The battle of pursuit begins.
The hunters and the hunted.
The intense emotions of friends made foe...\Nspill and clash on the battlefield.
But soldiers are falling far too quickly.
In a gamble waging the fate of humanity,\NErwin executes a do-or-die strategy.
